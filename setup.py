"""Strata one-click setup and start (Windows and Linux, NVIDIA or AMD GPUs).

    START-HERE.bat  (Windows)   /   ./setup.sh  (Linux)      - they install Python if needed and run this file

The first time it asks four questions - which model (the original Qwen3.8-Flash-Next or the Swift 1.5 fine-tune),
which size, how much context, and whether the model should also read images - then installs everything and starts the model on http://127.0.0.1:8080 (OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible
API; a small page there shows that it runs). Every later start skips straight to running the model: nothing that
is already downloaded, installed or prepared is done again.

What the first run does (each step is skipped when it is already done):

  1. checks your PC: NVIDIA or AMD GPU and driver, RAM, CPU, free disk space
  2. asks the questions
  3. installs the Python packages it needs into .venv (numpy, jinja2, ..., and NVIDIA's CUDA libraries)
  4. gets the Strata engine: a ready-made build for RTX 20/30/40/50 cards (no compiler needed); if none fits your PC,
     it installs the build tools (asks first) and compiles the engine for your GPU.  AMD (--backend hip, chosen by
     itself on a PC with no usable NVIDIA card): the ready-made HIP engine on Windows, compiled here on Linux
  5. downloads the model from Hugging Face (resumable), and the vision encoder if you want images
  6. prepares the model for Strata and fetches the MTP draft layer (~5 GB, from the original Qwen checkpoint)
  7. writes run-<model>.bat / run-<model>.sh and starts the model

Options: --family qwen|swift, --model Q2_0|IQ2_XS|IQ3_XXS|IQ3_S, --context 32768, --rope-scaling none|linear|yarn
(--rope-scale F; past the trained 262144 the setup adds yarn and the factor is the final context over 262144,
at least 1 - an explicit --rope-scaling none is refused for such a context), --vision yes|no|gpu|cpu, --port
8080, --yes (recommended
answers, no questions), --setup (install another model / change settings instead of starting), --no-start,
--host 0.0.0.0 --api-key KEY (reach it from other devices on your network), --experimental-speed-projection on|off
(EXPERIMENTAL, off by default),
--models-dir DIR, --gguf-dir DIR (use GGUF files you already have), --build (compile instead of the ready-made
engine), --check (only check this PC), --resident-budget-gib N (UD-Q4_K_XL's or UD-IQ4_XS's experts in RAM),
--kv-streaming on|off|auto.

Setup recommends, it never forces: the recommended answers are the defaults (--yes, or Enter), and a bigger choice
than it recommends - a longer context, more GPUs, a bigger RAM budget, a size it thinks will not fit - is kept, with
what it risks.  With --yes, an explicit flag (--model, --gpus, ...) is the consent to a risk setup would otherwise
stop at; --yes alone is not.

    Without this, a ready-made engine is installed on nothing more than the byte count matching the
    server's Content-Length - and a substituted file of the same length passes that.  It runs before the
    archive is opened, so a wrong engine never reaches `_unpack`, let alone the engine directory.

    Raises UnverifiedEngine on a refusal; the caller decides whether that stops setup (a first install,
    with nothing to fall back to) or keeps the engine that is already there (an update).

    Where the hash comes from, and where it cannot:

    - a GitHub release URL: the tag is read out of the URL, so the exact release the bytes claim to come
      from is the one checked rather than "latest" (setup tries the checkout's own release first, #214),
      and the repository comes out of the URL too, so a fork's releases are checked against the fork;
    - a local folder (`--prebuilt D:/mirror`): nothing published to check against.  This warns and goes
      ahead - it is the user's own file, the same trust decision as `--gguf-dir`, and there is nothing an
      API could say about it;
    - any other remote mirror: nothing published to check against either, but a network is in the middle,
      so it warns and installs anyway (no digest is never a reason to refuse).

    What a digest from the API does NOT cover, stated plainly: it proves the bytes are the ones GitHub
    published for that asset, so it catches a corrupted transfer, a mirror or proxy that substituted the
    file, and a hostile network.  It does not make a malicious RELEASE safe - if whoever can publish a
    release publishes a hostile engine, the digest matches it.  Only a hash pinned in this file closes
    that, at the cost of a commit per release; a dict of tag -> sha next to `engine_digest` is where one
    would go.

    The size and the hashing below are spelled out rather than delegated to `verify_sha256`, for two
    reasons, both measured here.  That function ends in `fail()`, and a refusal has to be an Exception so
    the update paths can fall back.  And it keeps a `.done` mark so 111 GB of Unsloth shards is hashed
    once; the engine archive is 190 MB, which hashes in 0.79 s at 242 MB/s on this machine, against 3.0 s
    to download the same file.  A mark that saves 0.8 s is not worth a class of hole - anything that
    changes the file after it was verified, at any length - so there is no mark here.
