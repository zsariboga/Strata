// Foresight swap space (opt-in: STRATA_FS_SLOTS > 0; unset = nothing here exists and the engine is unchanged).
//
// A few VRAM slots per layer on each card, apart from the expert cache, refilled on their own copy stream with experts
// that just missed.  The verify pool asks, for every expert it would otherwise give the CPU, whether that expert sits
// in a slot whose copy has landed; if so the expert becomes a plain GPU group (kind 0) pointing at the slot, exactly
// like a cache hit - the grouped kernel reads whatever address the plan carries, so no kernel changes.  The host pool
// decides and the GPU follows the plan, so both always agree on who computes an expert.
//
// Safety: a slot is refilled only when every window that may have read it has finished: each plan reference stamps
// the slot with the count of finished verify windows, and a slot is reusable once `depth` more windows finished
// (STRATA_FS_DEPTH, default 4; --pipeline-windows 2 keeps at most two windows in flight).  A copy that has not landed
// is simply not used (the CPU computes the expert as before).  Not with STRATA_VERIFY_DEVICE_PLAN (the device would
// plan resident layers without the host).
//
// With STRATA_FS_AHEAD=1 (default 1 when the swap space is on) the router look-ahead (RouterLookahead, one layer ahead on the
// previous layer's MoE input) also feeds the slots, not only the page warming of the file tier.
//
// Switches: STRATA_FS_SLOTS (per layer and card), STRATA_FS_BUDGET (copies per card per finished window, default 32),
// STRATA_FS_ADMIT (misses within the last 4 windows before an expert is copied, default 1), STRATA_FS_DEPTH,
// STRATA_FS_VERIFY=1 (test mode: every slot is read back and compared with its source the first time it is used).
