// include/strata/platform/direct_file.hpp - plan v0.3 P1/P2: unbuffered asynchronous file reads.
//
// The n-gram table (26.8 GiB) stays on the SSD and must never occupy RAM, including the OS file cache. A memory
// map cannot promise that; an unbuffered read can. On Windows this is FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING | OVERLAPPED with
// an I/O completion port; on Linux, O_DIRECT preads.  Both issue the reads from a small thread pool (submit only
// queues), so many reads are in flight: STRATA_IO_THREADS sets its size (default 4 on Windows, 16 on Linux).
//
// Contract of every read: offset, length and buffer address are multiples of `alignment()` (4096 here).
// Reads past end of file return the bytes that exist; `Completion::bytes` says how many.
