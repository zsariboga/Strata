// include/strata/ngram/ple_reader.hpp - plan v0.3 P2: the n-gram table read straight from the SSD.
//
// The table is 320,001,536 rows of 90 bytes (IQ4_NL, 26.8 GiB) or 160 (FP8 E4M3, 51.2 GB) and is never held in RAM: every row comes from an
// unbuffered 4 KiB read (platform::DirectFile). A token needs 16 rows on 16 different pages, and all 16 depend
// on the token itself, so the only time to hide them is the embedding plus layer 0. Hence the split API:
//
//     Ticket t = reader.issue(rows, n, out_raw);    // as soon as the token id is known
//     ...                                           // embedding, layer 0
//     reader.collect(t);                            // before layer 1 reads the rows
//
// `issue` also serves prefill: pass all 16 x N rows of a chunk; pages are deduplicated, sorted by offset and
// kept at most `max_inflight` deep, so a chunk's reads can run while the previous chunk computes.
//
// THE ROW CACHE IS NOT THE TABLE. It keeps rows this process has already fetched (90 bytes each, bounded,
// clock eviction). Measured on the frozen corpus (bench/results/2026-09-23-ngram-io): 1M rows (~95 MB)
// would serve up to ~82% of reads; within one long prompt 20-34% of rows recur. Capacity 0 disables it.
