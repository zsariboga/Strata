// include/strata/kernels/qsa_prompt_attn.hpp - perf-review D-1: the prompt path's QSA attention on tensor cores.
//
// `qsa_decode_attn_batch` serves a prompt one query at a time with the decode kernel: FP32 dot products with a warp
// reduction per head and cell, 64-cell chunks whose partial sums go through global scratch to a second (merge)
// kernel. At 32K that is 21% of the prompt (5.6 s of 26 s on a 5070, Q2_0, int8 KV), and it is limited by
// instruction issue, not memory (~150 GB/s of logical reads, 3.4 TFLOP/s).
//
// This kernel keeps the same per-query selection (no masking, no union) and reads the same pools, but:
//   * one block per (query, KV head) walks all its selected cells in chunks of 32 with an online softmax: no
//     split-K scratch and no merge kernel;
//   * q.k and p.v are m16n8k16 FP16 MMAs with FP32 accumulation over the 12 query heads of the KV head (+4 pad rows);
//   * the stored values enter exactly: int8 codes are exact in FP16 and their per-64 scales are applied in FP32
//     (to the q.k partial of each 64-dim group, and folded into p for p.v); FP16 KV is used as is;
//   * q and p are split into FP16 hi + lo parts (two MMAs each), so they keep ~22 bits: the result differs from
//     the FP32 kernel by summation order and the exp2 rounding, not by an FP16 cast.
// Not bitwise equal to `qsa_decode_attn_batch`; `qsa_prompt_attn_parity` bounds the difference and the prompt
// quality gate (needles, teacher-forced top-1) checks it end to end. Q4_0 KV (mode 4): each block's codes enter
// exactly as int8 and its scale (one per 32 values) in FP32, as int8 KV's do (STRATA_PROMPT_ATTN_Q4=0: the old kernel).
