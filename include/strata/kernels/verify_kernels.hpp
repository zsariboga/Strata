// include/strata/kernels/verify_kernels.hpp - plan v0.3 P6: kernels for the speculative VERIFY window, where T
// tokens (the last accepted token and T-1 drafts) go through a layer at once.
//
// The GDN recurrence is the one piece of state that cannot simply be overwritten by the next window, so its
// kernels come in two halves:
//
//   * the verify half reads the conv history and the recurrent state, runs all T tokens in order (bitwise the
//     single-token kernels' arithmetic per token) and writes ONLY the per-token outputs - the state is left
//     untouched;
//   * the commit half, launched once acceptance is known, replays the first `n_keep` tokens from the inputs the
//     verify half stored and writes the state.  Rejected tokens therefore never touch the state and there is no
//     snapshot of the 113 MB recurrent state to keep.
//
// Everything that varies per window (token ids, `n_keep`) is read from DEVICE memory so the kernels can be captured.
