// include/strata/kernels/ngram.hpp - P2.S4: the PLE n-gram hash and the per-layer token table.
//
// Two halves that share nothing but the row indices they exchange:
//
//   * `ngram_rows` - the HOST hash.  Sixteen row indices per token from the last three token ids, computed
//     with 64-bit multiply/xor and no tensor op at all.  `qwen4exp.cpp` L1092-1124, where the source says
//     outright that it is host-side because "ggml has no int64 and no xor".
//   * `PleTable`  - the row gather.  `per_layer_token_embd.weight` is IQ4_NL and is NOT IN THE PACK: it is
//     51.2e9 elements (28.8 GB) in the ORIGINAL second GGUF shard, and it is the only tensor this engine
//     reads from the GGUF rather than from the canonical pack.
//
// THE HASH IS THE ONE PLACE IN THIS MODEL WHERE A WRONG BIT IS SILENTLY PLAUSIBLE.  Every one of its
// properties has a rival reading that produces a valid index in range:
//
//   * XOR, not sum.  Two equal tokens with equal multipliers cancel to zero under XOR and double under sum.
//   * `%` vocab_size, not `& (vocab_size-1)`.  The vocab sizes are 20000003, 20000023, 20000033, ... - not
//     powers of two, so a mask would be a different function.
//   * the EOS cut propagates FORWARD: an EOS at any position replaces that position AND every older one.
//   * a missing predecessor is `LLAMA_TOKEN_NULL = -1`, tested as `t < 0`.  Token id 0 is a REAL token.
//   * the token's OWN eos does not cut its own context - only the predecessors are examined.
//
// All of those are asserted observable in `ple_parity.cpp` rather than trusted.

// THERE IS NO LINUX, SO THERE IS NO MADV_RANDOM HERE.  Windows has no equivalent of the advice - the closest

// whole handle, and `PrefetchVirtualMemory` for the positive case.  `GgufFile` opens with neither, so this
// build gets the DEFAULT sequential read-ahead on a random access pattern.  Saying so is the point: a
// comment claiming MADV_RANDOM here would be a comment about code that does not run.  On Linux the advice
// belongs in `GgufFile::open`, which this module does not own.
