## Speed (measured)

RTX 5070 **12 GB**, Ryzen 5 7600 (6 cores), 64 GB DDR5-5200, Windows, engine 0.1.26 with the settings setup writes
(`--prefill auto`, 8-bit KV above 4K, KV streaming from 64K). One code-agent prompt per length, 256 generated tokens,
MTP speculative decoding on. "262K" is the model's full context window (a 259,943-token prompt). The IQ2_XS row was
measured with Swift 1.5's IQ2_XS, which runs at the original's speed.

**Engine 0.1.36 (#136), the same PC:** Q2_0's prompt experts run on fused int8 tensor-core kernels (RTX 30 and newer):
4K 1,294 -> 1,570, 32K 2,170 -> 2,653, 128K 2,123 -> 2,468 tokens/s (+16-22%), as close to an FP16 reference as the
previous kernels (closer at 32K: teacher-forced KL 0.009 vs 0.012). The decode path's block selection and greedy
argmax run on thread-block clusters (RTX 50, sm_90+; other cards keep the previous kernels; the same tokens): Q2_0 output at 4K 89 -> 93.5, at 128K
64.5 -> 76.4 tokens/s. `STRATA_PF_FUSED=0` keeps the previous prompt kernels (byte-identical answers to 0.1.35);
`STRATA_PF_FUSED=1` also runs the native IQ packs' fused kernels (opt-in: IQ2_XS prompts +12% at 4K, +3% at 32K, the
IQ3 packs about even); `STRATA_QSA_CLUSTER=0` / `STRATA_ARGMAX_MULTI=0` turn the decode kernels off. The tables
below are 0.1.26's.

### Prompt processing (tokens/s)

Engine 0.1.26; `bench/results/2026-09-29-speed-0126`. The AMD RX 7900 XTX row: engine 0.1.38 on a ROCm
10.2 nightly with a tuned gfx1100 hipBLASLt-100500 table (upstream as [#755](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/pull/755)),
the median of 3 clean cells per tier
(Ryzen 9 7900X, 96 GB; 1K-128K one-shot runs, 256 generated tokens,
greedy). At 32K-128K that is 8-28% faster than 0.1.22. † not measured
again: 0.1.22. \* measured with images on (the image encoder's VRAM reserve leaves fewer experts cached). \*\* not
measured again: 0.1.14.

### Output (tokens/s)

| Model | 1K | 4K | 32K | 64K | 128K | 262K |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

Engine 0.1.26, the same runs. The AMD RX 7900 XTX row: engine 0.1.38 on a ROCm 10.2 nightly (tuned
gfx1100 hipBLASLt-100500 table, upstream as [#755](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/pull/755)), median of 3 clean cells per tier (same box; decode is flat in
context - the GDN linear attention is O(1) per token; 1K/4K prefill ran slightly under the 0.1.31
packaged-ROCm numbers, 32K-128K ahead). † not measured again: 0.1.14.

Output speed depends on the text as well: speculative decoding runs faster when more of the drafted tokens are
accepted, so a different answer to the same prompt moves it by several percent. Run back to back on the 4K prompt,
0.1.14 writes 88.5 tokens/s and 0.1.12 85.7. The numbers before 0.1.13 (prompts about half as fast):
[`bench/results/2026-09-24-final`](../bench/results/2026-09-24-final/matrix.md); these:
[`bench/results/2026-09-28-speed-0114`](../bench/results/2026-09-28-speed-0114/README.md).

IQ3_XXS and IQ3_S at 262K are not measured: with their 43 / 50 GB of experts, a 260K-token context brings a 64 GB PC
to its memory limit by setup's estimate (the experts + the context's KV cache + 24 GB), so setup recommends up to 128K
with them on 64 GB. A longer context you choose (`--context 262144`, or a pick in its list) is kept, with a note: users
ran IQ3_S at 256K on 64 GB with RAM to spare (#406). In the low-RAM mode the KV cache stays in VRAM and the context
does not count against RAM. IQ3_S (engine 0.1.4 or newer) is only published for the original model, not for Swift 1.5.

**KV streaming (engine 0.1.5):** at 64K and more, setup keeps the context's KV cache in RAM and only the part the
attention reads in VRAM (`--kv-resident 32768`), so more experts fit on the GPU. Q2_0 at 262K: 50.9 -> 62.6 tokens/s
(1,589 -> 3,872 experts in VRAM); at 128K about +6%. The attention reads exactly the same values (only where the KV lives changes); it
costs ~13.7 KB of RAM per context token (1.7 GB at 128K). Existing installs: run `START-HERE.bat --setup` once to turn
it on. Setup turns it on when the RAM has room for it; `--kv-streaming on|off` overrides that (on past the RAM test with a
note; never under WSL, which cannot stream).

**4-bit KV cache (engine 0.1.8, optional):** `START-HERE.bat --setup` asks above 8K context (or pass `--kv q4_0`). It
halves the KV cache's memory with a Hadamard rotation before 4-bit rounding (PR #21), about 4% faster at 128K, but it
is measurably less precise on long documents (perplexity +8-12%; needle tests still pass). 8-bit stays the default.
Details: [`bench/results/2026-09-27-kv-q4`](../bench/results/2026-09-27-kv-q4/README.md).

**Hybrid K8V4 KV cache (engine 0.1.25, optional, PR #120):** `--kv k8v4` (`START-HERE.bat --setup --kv k8v4`) keeps
the keys at 8 bits and stores the values as rotated 4-bit: 23% less KV memory than 8-bit, so more experts fit in
VRAM. RTX 3090, the Coder at 198K context: 99 instead of 85 tokens/s output, the same needle results, prompts 2-5%
slower. It streams its KV cache like the other formats (`--kv-resident N`): on an RTX 2060 SUPER 8 GB at 128K with
20,480 resident cells, +780 expert slots over resident K8V4, and it scores better than 4-bit KV on long documents.

**Reproducible greedy output (0.1.30, opt-in, `STRATA_IQ_MT_MIN=1`):** with the IQ models, the CPU computes an
expert for one token with ggml's dot product and for several tokens with Strata's multi-token kernels, which round
slightly differently. How many tokens share an expert depends on the drafts in a verify window, so the same prompt
at temperature 0 can end in a different (equally good) answer when the drafting, the cache state or a resumed
conversation differ (issue #152). `STRATA_IQ_MT_MIN=1` (in the config's `env`) uses the multi-token kernels for
every group: the answer then no longer depends on the drafting. Measured on a Ryzen 7600 (AVX-512): IQ3_S decode
-1..-3%, the other models the same; the default stays the fastest rule. On an Intel CPU of Alder Lake or later
without AVX-512, where the AVX-2 kernel gathers the IQ3_S grid, `STRATA_IQ3S_MT1=1` (opt-in) gives IQ3_S the multi-token
kernel for one token, which is the faster one there; it changes a lone token's rounding, so it is off by default. Through the server, two more things carry
over from one request to the next (#410): the adaptive tier moves experts between RAM and VRAM (the GPU and the CPU
round an expert differently), and the prompt cache resumes a repeated prompt and reads only its tail through the
decode path. For byte-identical repeats add `--prompt-cache 0 --adapt-swaps 0 --pcie-frac 0` to the engine's args
as well (#410): the PCIe share of the missed experts (computed on the GPU instead of the CPU) still made the first
answer after a start differ from the next ones. Measured here (IQ3_XXS, a 3.6K-token prompt, 4 repeats): with all
three switches 1 answer of 4, without `--pcie-frac 0` 2 of 4 (the first one differs), with the defaults 2 of 4.
`--pcie-frac 0` costs decode speed (the missed experts all run on the CPU), so keep it for A/B runs.

**Coupled drafts with Gumbel-max picks (opt-in, `STRATA_SPEC_COUPLED=1` and `STRATA_SPEC_GUMBEL=1`):** for a request
that samples (temperature above 0), `STRATA_SPEC_COUPLED=1` lets the draft layer sample its guesses with the target's own
chain and random draw instead of taking its most likely token. `STRATA_SPEC_GUMBEL=1` changes how both of them pick from
that chain: the token with the largest p / E, where E is exponential noise keyed by the seed, the position and the token
id (the Gumbel-max trick; it is still an exact sample of the same distribution). With the default pick, one random number
walked over the candidates sorted by probability, a draft and a target whose candidate lists differ in one token tend to
land on different tokens; with noise keyed by the token, a token gets the same noise on both sides, so they agree on the
tokens they share. Greedy requests are unchanged, and without the variables nothing changes. Measured on a Ryzen AI
Max+ 395 (Radeon 8060S, Linux, ROCm 7.14.1, the iGPU alone), UD-Q4_K_XL, `--spec 4 --mtp` (the base model's draft
layer), temperature 1.0 / top_p 0.95 / top_k 20, a 1.3K-token prompt and 512 output tokens, 12-13 requests per arm:
drafts accepted 52.8% -> 59.9%, tokens per verify window 2.65 -> 2.88, output 41.1 -> 44.9 tokens/s (+9%); a window
costs the same (draft 8.8 -> 9.1 ms of 64). `sampler_parity` checks the pick against a host reference on every sampled
path, and that its frequencies match the softmax. On an RTX 3060 (IQ3_XXS, `--spec 4 --mtp`, temperature 1.0 / top_p 0.95 / top_k 20, 12 interleaved pairs of 200-token story and code requests) `STRATA_SPEC_COUPLED=1` raised the accepted drafts from 62.1% to 66.9% and adding `STRATA_SPEC_GUMBEL=1` to 68.0%, but decode speed did not move beyond the run-to-run spread (median 43.3 tok/s with coupled alone, 42.8 with Gumbel as well): try it on your own card before relying on it.

**The draft layer's tokens (0.1.27, `--draft-vocab`):** the MTP draft layer can only propose tokens from a subset
of the vocabulary (`mtp/rt/draft_vocab.bin`). Since 0.1.27 the subset includes every Chinese, Japanese and Korean
token (106,299 ids), so answers in those languages are 15-38% faster (Q2_0, RTX 5070). Its head takes ~180 MiB of
VRAM, which the expert cache leaves free for it (0.1.28). `START-HERE.bat --setup --draft-vocab en` keeps the
English/code subset from before (40,525 ids, ~110 MiB less VRAM, English answers 1-2% faster; CJK answers get
almost no drafts). `--draft-vocab cyrillic` takes the English/code subset plus the whole Cyrillic script (58,963
ids): the shipped subsets hold 142 of the vocabulary's 18,580 Cyrillic tokens, so Ukrainian or Russian answers got
1.4 tokens a round; with it 2.1, and 83 -> 109 tokens/s (RTX 5090, the NVFP4 fork), English unchanged.
`--draft-vocab fr` (0.1.39, #597) takes the English/code subset plus the 5,686 tokens that cover 99% of a French
Wikipedia corpus (46,211 ids, `tools/draft_vocab.py --corpus`): 23.6% of French text's tokens were outside the
English/code subset, 0.7% are outside this one. Drafts accepted in French answers 0.51 -> 0.60 (IQ3_XXS, RTX 5070,
8 prompts x 2 passes; English 0.61 -> 0.63 and code 0.77 -> 0.78, no loss), and 141 -> 158 tok/s in French on an
RTX 5090 (IQ3_S, the reporter's measurement).
`tools/draft_vocab.py` builds and inspects subsets. When the start stops with "the draft head does not fit" (a
12 GB card with a long context, #474), the engine says how much the head needs, how much VRAM is free and which
smaller subset fits, and the server's start error repeats it; setup suggests `--draft-vocab en` on cards under
14 GB (only a suggestion: nothing changes unless you pass it).

**Serving without the draft layer (`--mtp` is optional):** `serve` runs without `--mtp`. Drafts then come from the
suffix/prompt-lookup drafter only (or one token per round), every token is still verified against the model, and the
draft layer's VRAM (~0.7-1 GiB with its head) goes to the expert cache: 1,000 -> 1,678 slots in one A/B on an 8 GB
card. The conversation cache (`--conversation-cache-mib`) stays on: a parked conversation then carries no draft K/V.

**Low-RAM mode (engine 0.1.26, chosen by setup):** normally all of a model's experts are copied into RAM (23-50 GB,
pinned) and the GPU holds a copy of the most-used ones. On a PC whose RAM cannot hold them beside the system (the
experts plus ~10 GB), setup instead maps them from one file in the model's folder (`--mmap-experts`, the pack's
`experts.bin`, +23-50 GB of disk). The OS file cache holds what the GPU does not, and it can give that memory back.
On the Coder the engine's committed memory drops from 36 to ~13 GB, with the same answers. With a big GPU (an RTX
5090 holds all of the Coder's experts, most of Q2_0's) it runs at nearly the usual speed. With a small one, most
experts come from the SSD and it is much slower (setup says so). `START-HERE.bat --setup --low-ram on|off` overrides
the choice.

**Low-RAM mode, resident (engine 0.1.30):** when the experts the GPU does not hold fit the RAM (with the same ~10 GB
beside them), setup picks the resident variant instead (`--resident-experts`): at start the engine copies exactly those
experts from `experts.bin` into RAM (page-locked when the driver allows, else locked in RAM), so while it answers
nothing is read from the SSD, however little RAM the OS leaves for its file cache. Examples with setup's context: a
32 GB PC with a 24 GB GPU runs Q2_0, IQ2_XS and the Coder this way (~16-18 GB of experts in RAM, the GPU holds the
other ~18 GB), a 32 GB PC with a 12-16 GB GPU the Coder; IQ3_XXS on a 32 GB PC stays mapped. The details:
- The prompt path borrows room in the GPU's expert cache for its buffers and puts those experts back after the prompt;
  as far as the RAM allows, their experts are kept in RAM too (so a prompt reads nothing from the SSD either).
- The cache still follows the conversation (`--adapt-every`): a swap copies the evicted expert back from VRAM into the
  RAM place of the one that replaces it, so the RAM copy keeps holding exactly what the GPU does not.
- `--adapt-async 1` (opt-in, `--serve`): the swaps of a round advance between decode windows on a helper thread
  (copy back, copy in, move into RAM) instead of one window waiting for the whole round. Not with `--batch` or
  `--peer-device` (the blocking tier runs there). With `--pipeline-windows 2` (two windows in flight, see
  [MULTI_GPU.md](MULTI_GPU.md)) the copies into the evicted slots and the moves into RAM also wait until the windows
  that were in flight when they were decided have completed (`STRATA_PIPELINE_ADAPT_ASYNC=0`: the blocking tier
  there). It is not bit-exact from run to run: which window first computes a swapped-in expert on the GPU (which
  rounds differently from the CPU) depends on when its copy lands.
  It stays on the blocking tier (said in the log) when the exchange buffers are not page-locked; the stats line
  reports ms per round.
- `STRATA_EXCHANGE_ROTATE=1` (opt-in): an adaptive swap hands buffer ownership over instead of copying the evicted
  blob into the RAM copy (equal-size blobs, fully page-locked copy). Same tokens, fewer host copies; it works with
  `--adapt-async 1` too. Details and the measurement: [EXCHANGE_ROTATION.md](EXCHANGE_ROTATION.md).
- The answers are the plain mapped mode's for the same expert placement: the bytes are the file's. With a page-locked
  copy the GPU also takes its usual share of the misses over PCIe (`--pcie-frac`), as with enough RAM; `--pcie-frac 0`
  (or `STRATA_RESIDENT_PIN=0`) gives the mapped mode's exact tokens.
- The engine leaves 4 GB of the RAM it finds free (`STRATA_RESIDENT_HEADROOM_GIB`); when even the experts the GPU does
  not hold do not fit, it says so and runs the plain mapped mode. The server log shows, per request, how many expert
  reads went to the file (`resident RAM: ... blob reads from the file`: 0 in steady use).
- `--low-ram resident|mmap` forces one variant (also on a PC with enough RAM, e.g. to try it).
- Several GPUs (#364, #384): setup recommends one GPU in the low-RAM mode (the resident variant has no layer split
  yet), and asks; `--gpus 0,1` (or answering 2) shares the model across them with the mapped variant
  (`--mmap-experts`): the cards together hold more of the experts, and two users measured it 1.3-1.6x faster than
  one card, but the OS file cache can fill the RAM to 0 free during long prompts. `--yes` keeps one GPU. A config
  with `--resident-experts` started with `--gpus` switches to `--mmap-experts` with a note, and the engine runs that
  pair as `--mmap-experts` with a warning instead of refusing it. **Since 0.1.40 (#642, #848)** setup requires an
  engine that runs the resident variant on a split, so it keeps both cards, resident, as for any config:
  [MULTI_GPU.md](MULTI_GPU.md#using-it).

**A mapped arena for small RAM (Linux, opt-in, 0.1.39, PR #640):** `STRATA_ARENA_MMAP=1` maps a native pack's expert
arena read-only from the pack's `experts.bin` instead of reading it into locked RAM, for a PC whose GPUs hold most
experts but whose RAM is small (2x 16 GB GPUs with 32 GB of RAM: ~1 GB -> 25 GB available while serving). The first
start writes `experts.bin` (when the drive has room for it), later starts map it; the pages of the experts a GPU holds
are handed back to the OS. Run it with `--pcie-frac 0` (the GPUs get no mapped alias). Without the variable nothing
changes.

**Releasing mapped expert pages on Windows (opt-in):** `STRATA_FILE_RELEASE=1` lets `FileExpertSource` trim the
full file-backed pages of experts after their GPU uploads complete, including the slots lent to prefill and then
refilled. It works with `experts.bin` and the direct GGUF views; shared boundary pages and private/pinned buffers
are left alone. Unset or `0` keeps the previous behavior. On one 32 GB Windows 11 laptop with an RTX 4080 Laptop
and a Thunderbolt RTX 3090, IQ2_XS with `--mmap-experts --layer-split 12 --trim-stage-weights` raised median available
RAM from 0.51 to 12.19 GiB across 1K/4K/16K prompt trials, with 3.7-4.4% lower prefill throughput. It did not reduce
committed memory or physical SSD reads. This is a working-set hint, not an unmap or a guarantee that the OS drops
its file cache. See the [configuration, measurements and limits](../bench/results/2026-10-04-windows-mapped-release/README.md).

**Low-RAM mode without `experts.bin` (engine 0.1.31):** for the native packs (IQ2_XS, IQ3_XXS, IQ3_S, the Coder, Swift,
Q2_0 packed by `tools/iq_pack.py`; not the canonical Q2_0 pack setup makes for AVX-512 CPUs) the mapped mode no longer
needs the pack's `experts.bin`: when the pack has none, the engine
maps the model's GGUF files themselves and reads each expert's gate, up and down rows from where `native_experts.txt`
says they are (the files are checked against it first: every tensor's name, type, shape, offset and bounds). That
saves the 23-50 GB copy on the disk. The answers are the same: on the Coder, 64 greedy tokens from `experts.bin` and
from the GGUF gave identical tokens and logits. An expert read from the GGUF is three reads instead of one, so the
engine fetches a layer's missing experts on 8 threads (`STRATA_FETCH_THREADS`) with one batched page request
(Windows `PrefetchVirtualMemory`). With an `experts.bin` in the pack, nothing changes. Setup does not use this yet.

**Linux file-tier I/O path (opt in, `STRATA_IO_PREFETCH=1`; 0.1.40.2):** the mapped file tier reads experts through
page faults. With this on, the layer's uncached experts and the router-predicted ones of the next layer (`STRATA_LOOKAHEAD_K`,
`STRATA_IO_PREFETCH_DEPTH`, default 2 when on) are read by I/O threads (`STRATA_IO_PF_THREADS`, default 8) with whole-blob
`pread`s into the page cache, and the CPU kernels read the mapping as before. The bytes are the same, so the output is the
same (greedy IQ3_XXS and Q2_0 hashes identical, prefetch off vs on). `STRATA_IO_PF_STAGE=1` instead stages every uncached
expert in a buffer and makes the layer wait for them; `STRATA_IO_PF_AHEAD=0` keeps only the demand reads. The per-request
log line "file tier I/O" shows what the OS read from the drive (/proc/self/io, major faults) against the engine's expert
reads; `STRATA_IO_STATS=1` (or prefetch on) adds the page-cache hit / miss split (mincore) and the read-ahead used / unused counts.
Measured (interleaved A/B, 10 pairs, 200-token greedy medians, page cache dropped before each run, memory limit by cgroup):

| box, lane | default (fill) | `STRATA_IO_PF_STAGE=1` |
|---|---|---|
| RTX 3060, 32 GB, IQ3_XXS | -3.4% | **+25.7%** |
| RTX 3060, 16 GB, IQ3_XXS | -1.8% | -32.6% |
| Radeon 780M iGPU, 16 GB, Q2_0 (adaptive tier off) | -0.7% (story +3.8%, code +4.1%) | -19% |

With the experts warm in the page cache (46 GB on the 3060, 60 GB on the iGPU box) the file tier already runs at the
resident speed, so there is nothing to win; the gap is the cold start and the low-RAM lanes. So it is off by default, and
the staging variant is worth trying only on a 32 GB-class box. **iGPU caveat:** on a Radeon 780M, prefetch together with the
adaptive tier (`--adapt-every`, on by default) under memory pressure reset the GPU in about 7 of 9 runs (the engine
prints a warning and runs as asked); with `--adapt-every 100000` there were no resets in ~40 runs. The cause is not found.

**A RAM budget (engine 0.1.31, `--resident-budget-gib N`):** the resident variant for a model whose experts do not all
fit: the N GiB of experts the GPU cache does not hold that the expert profile ranks hottest are copied into RAM at
start (locked; page-locked when the driver allows the whole budget), and the rest are read from the files.
It implies `--mmap-experts` and leaves 4 GiB of headroom. On Windows, available commit capacity also
limits the budget; a larger N is clamped to the smaller limit less 4 GiB and a 256 MiB margin, with a message.
A clamped budget no longer fails the safety check that follows (#403). A budget that cannot be kept at all is a
warning, with every expert read from the files. Setup sets N with `--resident-budget-gib N`. With
the GGUF read in place it also warms the next layer's likely experts: while the CPU works on a layer, a thread applies
the next layer's router to this layer's input and asks the OS for the pages of the predicted experts that neither the
GPU nor the RAM budget holds (only pages - the experts computed are the same; `STRATA_LOOKAHEAD=0` turns it off). This
is what runs [Unsloth's UD-Q4_K_XL](UNSLOTH_Q4.md) (72 GiB of experts) on a 64 GB PC: 7-8.5 tokens/s at N = 40 on an
RTX 5070, against ~3 tokens/s before these changes.

**Switches added in 0.1.40 (all off unless noted; none changes the default output):**
- `--kv-grow` (or `STRATA_KV_GROW=1`; `--no-kv-grow` turns it off): the K/V takes VRAM only for the cells the requests
  reach, and the expert cache holds the rest, giving slots back as the context grows. It needs one GPU, an expert
  profile, the whole K/V in VRAM (no KV streaming) and every expert in RAM (not the resident low-RAM mode); otherwise,
  and with `--batch`, `--vram-elastic` or `--peer-device`, the engine says so and stays off.
- `--host-core last` (or `STRATA_HOST_CORE=last`, Windows): the host thread runs on the last physical core and the
  workers take the first. Windows sends a GPU's interrupts to the first core, where a host spinning on the GPU's flags
  waits for them (`--host-core first` is the default; the startup log names the cores).
- `STRATA_ADAPT_LAG=2` (#764): a window takes the adaptive tier's swaps once they are two windows old (default 1,
  as 0.1.39). `STRATA_PREFILL_EQUAL=1` (#693): a prompt segment is read in chunks of equal size, not full chunks and a
  short last one (changes the rounding). `STRATA_OWNED_PRICE=exact` (#796): the cache sizing prices the prompt path's
  own buffers by their real allocation instead of 0.1.39's rule.
- `STRATA_Q2_BITPLANE=1`: a bit-plane row kernel for Q2_0 on CPUs with AVX2 and no AVX-512 (changes the last bits).
  `STRATA_NO_AVXVNNI=1` turns the AVX-VNNI forms of the i-quant, IQ4_NL and Q2_0 rows off on CPUs that have them
  (Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids and later); they give the same bits as the AVX2 forms, 4-25% faster rows.
- Draft layer: `--lookup-chain-min M` (the shortest context match `--lookup-chain` extends, default 3),
  `--mtp-hnorm stream` (one norm per stream, as llama.cpp's MTP graph) and `--mtp-draft-vocab FILE` (a token subset
  of your own instead of `<mtp>/draft_vocab.bin`).
- Elsewhere: HIP `STRATA_DENSE_MMQ=1` and `STRATA_HIP_ADAPT_KERNEL_COPY=1` in [AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md#model-and-serving-configuration);
  `STRATA_KEEP_EMPTY_TURNS=1` and `STRATA_TOPK_STREAM=0` in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).


**Read-ahead at start (Linux):** the weights, the native dense matrices, the GPU cache's fill from the profile, the
resident RAM copy and the MTP draft files are asked for ahead of their reads (madvise / posix_fadvise WILLNEED in
128 KiB steps), so the drive sees a deep queue instead of one page fault at a time. Measured on a Gen3 NVMe (RTX 5090,
32 GB, Q2_0 resident at 262K): ready in 70 s instead of ~920 s; the fill went from 39 MB/s to 3.2 GB/s.
`STRATA_READ_AHEAD=0` turns it off; `STRATA_FILL_AHEAD=N` sets how many fill pairs are asked for ahead (default 256).

**How much came from where:** with `--stats` the engine prints the tiers of the decode (`expert tiers`: blobs from the
RAM copy, blobs and MB from the files, the time spent reading them; `routing prefetch`: how many of the file reads had
been warmed). The server log has the same per request (`expert tiers: GPU ... hits ...; RAM ... blobs, files ...
blobs ... MB read`), and `GET /metrics` lists `ram_blobs`, `file_blobs` and `file_mb` for each recent request (with
engine 0.1.31 or newer). It also lists each request's speculative drafts, `drafts_offered` and `drafts_accepted`
(`null` when the engine did not report them), and their sums since the server started in `totals` (#457).
Its `hit_rate` is the VRAM share of the experts looked up while answering: experts the GPU reads over PCIe
(`--pcie-frac`) are not in it, so a higher `--pcie-frac` raises it even when decoding gets slower. `pcie_share`
(engine 0.1.39 or newer, #588) is their share of all routed experts, and the server log and the Monitor tab show it
beside the hit rate.

**Where a decode window's time goes (profiling, #610):** start the server with `STRATA_DECODE_TIMING=1` (and
`STRATA_VERIFY_PROFILE=1` for the GPU's side) in the environment. After each request the engine log then has one
`strata decode timing:` line - windows, tokens per window, and per window the verify time split into the wait for the
GPU, the CPU expert pool (plan, activation quantization, jobs) and the stage, plus commit and draft - and one
`strata decode GPU stages (ms/window):` line with the GPU time of each stage (GDN and QSA layers, the VRAM expert
hits, the router, the head, ...). The GPU profile times every stage with events, so it slows the decode a little:
use it to compare, not to measure speed. This works with every pack; `--gpu-stages` (a one-token replay of
per-layer graphs) refuses a native (IQ) pack, which has no such graphs.

Time to first token is prompt length / prompt speed: with Q2_0 about 4 s at 4K, 25 s at 32K, under 2 minutes at 128K
and 4.5 minutes at 262K (engine 0.1.13 made long prompts about twice as fast, below).

**Faster prompts (engine 0.1.13):** the prompt is read in chunks of up to 8,192 tokens instead of 2,048 (`--prefill
auto`: the largest chunk whose buffers fit in the expert-cache slots it borrows, and a request borrows only what its
prompt needs); the experts are multiplied by llama.cpp's quantized MMQ kernels instead of being expanded to FP16
first; the next layer's experts stream over PCIe while the current layer's attention runs; the PLE block runs for the
whole chunk at once; unpinned experts are copied by helper threads. Measured on the RTX 5070 12 GB, 64 GB RAM,
32K-token prompt: Q2_0 572 -> 1,290 tokens/s, IQ3_S 383 -> 1,208. Through the server (Q2_0, 128K context): 999 tokens
353 -> 438 tokens/s, 6,927 tokens 529 -> 1,077, 28,584 tokens 584 -> 1,249. Output speed is unchanged. Needles 5/5
(1K-262K). Details and the quality check:
[`bench/results/2026-09-28-prefill-speed`](../bench/results/2026-09-28-prefill-speed/README.md). Existing installs
switch to `--prefill auto` the next time START-HERE / setup.sh starts them. The raw numbers:
[`bench/results/`](../bench/results/). The [paper](paper/Strata-Paper.pdf) explains every number.

## Other GPUs (estimated)

Not measured - estimated from the runs above (same CPU and 64 GB RAM): the GPU part scaled by memory bandwidth, the CPU
part by how many more experts the card's VRAM holds. Treat as **±20%**. Numbers are *prompt / output* tokens/s.
The prompt figures predate engine 0.1.13, which about doubled prompt speed on the measured card; how much of that a
card gains depends on its PCIe link (the experts stream over it), so they are still the older estimates.

| GPU | Model | 1K | 4K | 32K | 64K | 128K | 262K |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| RTX 5060 Ti 16GB | Q2_0 | ~341 / ~80 | ~472 / ~87 | ~501 / ~81 | ~492 / ~72 | ~476 / ~62 | ~435 / ~53 |
|  | IQ2_XS | ~291 / ~80 | ~406 / ~77 | ~434 / ~63 | ~426 / ~62 | ~413 / ~51 | ~383 / ~47 |
|  | IQ3_XXS | ~249 / ~66 | ~359 / ~65 | ~381 / ~56 | ~374 / ~54 | ~363 / ~45 | - |
| RTX 3090 24GB | Q2_0 | ~355 / ~128 | ~491 / ~140 | ~521 / ~130 | ~512 / ~115 | ~495 / ~100 | ~453 / ~85 |
|  | IQ2_XS | ~303 / ~131 | ~422 / ~128 | ~451 / ~103 | ~444 / ~102 | ~430 / ~85 | ~398 / ~78 |
|  | IQ3_XXS | ~260 / ~106 | ~374 / ~103 | ~396 / ~89 | ~390 / ~85 | ~378 / ~71 | - |

More VRAM matters more than a faster GPU: every extra GB holds ~700 more experts, and every expert on the GPU is one the
CPU does not have to compute. A 3090's 24 GB takes most of the CPU work away. (Since 0.1.14 the expert profile ranks
all 24,576 experts; before, the cache stopped at 8,000, about 10-14 GB. `tools/make_profile.py` builds a profile from
your own prompts: run the engine once with `--dump-routing trace.bin`, see the tool's help. The shipped profile already
ranks every pair, so a trace only changes the order with `--reorder` (0.1.39, #587): your trace's pairs first, then the
base's, then the rest.)

## Which model?

All three are [ISTA-DASLab's GSQ-RCO quantizations](https://huggingface.co/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF)
of [Qwen3.8-Flash-Next](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next).

| Model | Download | RAM it uses | Speed | Quality |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| **Q2_0** | 66 GB | ~34 GB experts + ~6 GB | fastest | good |
| **IQ2_XS** | 68 GB | ~36 GB experts + ~6 GB | close to Q2_0 | a bit better |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 76 GB | ~43 GB experts + ~6 GB | slower (more CPU work) | best |

With 64 GB of RAM all three fit (close the browser for IQ3_XXS, and keep its context at 128K or less). With 48 GB only Q2_0 / IQ2_XS may fit. With 32 GB: the Coder (below).

### Or: the Coder (half the experts, for code)

**[Qwen3.8-Flash-Next GSQ-RCO Coder](https://huggingface.co/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-Coder-GGUF)** is
ISTA-DASLab's expert-pruned release: 256 of each layer's 512 experts are kept (still 10 active per token), chosen with
RCO on code, agentic and vision calibration data; its authors report 91.3% of the full model's SWE-bench Verified and
98.7% of LiveCodeBench v6. One size, named IQ1_M for its 1.89 bits per *original* parameter; the kept experts are
stored like IQ3_S (IQ2_S-IQ4_XS gate/up, IQ4_NL/Q2_0 down). Shard 1 is 29.6 GB (experts: 23 GB of RAM), so it runs
on **32 GB of RAM**, and at 262K on 64 GB. Its shard 2 and its vision encoder are the original's files: with the
original installed, setup downloads only shard 1. Strata ships its expert profile (`data/expert-profile-coder.bin`,
the shipped ranking mapped onto the kept experts through the release's `rco-allocation.txt`: 72% of the expert
reads hit the GPU on a 12 GB card). Images work; the experimental speed projection loads and runs on it (it was made
for the full model).

```
START-HERE.bat --setup --family coder
```

### Or: Swift 1.5 (a fine-tune that thinks shorter)

The setup's first question also offers **[Swift 1.5](https://huggingface.co/ukisai/Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF)**,
UkisAI's fine-tune of Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, trained to reach the answer with much less thinking (its authors: 63% fewer
thinking tokens, 1.8x sooner answers, under 1% accuracy loss). Same architecture, the same three sizes, its own
vision encoder; Strata runs it at the same speed (4K, IQ2_XS: 465 prompt / 78.7 output tokens/s, vs 467 / 78.3 for
the original). Its authors recommend **IQ2_XS** (their Q2_0 is marked experimental). Its license is the Swift Open
License 1.0 - read it on the model page.

Our small check (8 reasoning questions, default thinking, IQ2_XS): both models got **8/8**; Swift used **1,234**
output tokens in 28 s, the original **2,682** in 46 s - most of the difference from one question the original
thought about for 1,524 tokens. Not a benchmark, but consistent with the claim.

```
START-HERE.bat --setup --family swift --model IQ2_XS
```

### Experimental: Unsloth's UD-Q4_K_XL

A 4-bit quantization of the same model (111 GB, 72 GiB of experts). Setup offers it from engine 0.1.32
(`--family unsloth --model UD-Q4_K_XL`: a RAM budget of your RAM less 24 GB, the rest read from the SSD); what it
does and the manual workflow are in **[docs/UNSLOTH_Q4.md](UNSLOTH_Q4.md)**. On a 64 GB PC with a 12 GB RTX 5070 it writes 7-8.5
tokens/s, most experts read from the SSD; it picks the same tokens as llama.cpp on the same file at 97.5-99% of
the positions of short greedy answers, 90-91% after a 16K prompt, differing mostly at near-ties
([measured](UNSLOTH_Q4.md#quality-against-llamacpp-on-the-same-file)).

## Before you start

You need **only a graphics driver**: NVIDIA 580 or newer (update it with the NVIDIA App or from
[nvidia.com/drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers)), or for AMD the one in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#what-you-need).
Everything else is installed for you the first time.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| GPU | NVIDIA **RTX 20, 30, 40 or 50 series**, **12 GB VRAM or more** (8 GB runs, slowly). Measured on an RTX 5070 and an RTX 3090; RTX 20 (Turing, since 0.1.27) was tested by a contributor on an RTX 2070. Or AMD **Radeon RX 7900 XT / XTX, RX 7800 XT / 7700 XT, RX 9060 XT, RX 9070 / 9070 XT, Radeon AI PRO R9700, RX 6800 / 6900 series**: [AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md). |
| RAM | **64 GB** recommended (see the table above). |
| CPU | x86-64 with AVX2 (any Intel/AMD desktop CPU from the last ~8 years). AVX-512 (Ryzen 7000/9000) is a bit faster. Older CPUs without AVX2 are experimental and slow: [Older CPUs](INSTALL.md#older-cpus-experimental). |
| Disk | ~70-80 GB free for the model, ~6 GB for the MTP layer (+1 GB with images). **Q2_0 on an AVX-512 CPU** also writes a one-time ~40 GB pack for the fast CPU kernel (34 GB of experts in its layout, plus the dense weights). An NVMe SSD is strongly recommended. |
| OS | Windows 10/11, or Linux (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 get everything installed automatically). |

What the first start installs: in this folder `.venv/`, `engine/` and `third_party/`; the model files (`models/`,
`packs/`, `mtp/`, 70-120 GB) in **`Strata-data` next to this folder**, so a new copy of Strata (an update unzipped
elsewhere) finds them and sets itself up the same way. The place is remembered per user (`%APPDATA%\Strata\settings.json`,
`~/.config/strata/settings.json`); `--data-dir` chooses another. Installs from before 0.1.16 are moved there by the next
start (a rename on the same drive; files on another drive are used where they are).
Python 3.12 if you have none (for your user account, no admin), a private Python environment, NVIDIA's CUDA libraries
(from pip, ~0.4 GB), the ready-made Strata engine for RTX 20/30/40/50, the model and the MTP draft layer. If no
ready-made engine fits your PC, it offers to install the build tools (Visual Studio Build Tools + CUDA Toolkit on
Windows, `build-essential` + CUDA on Ubuntu) and compiles the engine for your GPU (asks first; 20-40 minutes once).

---

## Windows

### Double-click `START-HERE.bat`

**The first time** it asks four questions and does the rest:

1. **Which model?** Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (the original) or Swift 1.5 (the fine-tune that thinks shorter).
2. **Which size?** Q2_0, IQ2_XS or IQ3_XXS (it recommends one for your RAM).
3. **How much context?** 8K to 256K tokens (it recommends one for your VRAM).
4. **Images?** yes / no (see [Images](#images-vision)).

Then it downloads and prepares everything (the model is 66-76 GB, so the first start takes a while; an interrupted
download continues where it stopped) and **starts the model**: your browser opens `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, the Strata
app. It has three tabs:
- **Chat:** streaming answers, the model's thinking (folded away once it answers), code with a copy button, pictures when
  images are on, and sampling and thinking-level settings. Chats stay in your browser.
- **Monitor:** what the model is doing (reading the prompt, with progress, or writing, at how many tokens/s); GPU load,
  VRAM, temperature, power and PCIe traffic; CPU, RAM and disk; the context in use; the last requests.
- **About:** the model and engine settings, and the addresses to connect other apps.

`http://127.0.0.1:8080/?q=your question` opens it with a new chat already asking. The API is at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` for your apps.

**Every time after that**, `START-HERE.bat` just starts the model (30-90 s to load 34-43 GB into RAM). Nothing is
downloaded again. Closing the window stops the model.

```
START-HERE.bat --setup                          install another model, or change context / images
SETUP.bat                                       the same (double-click it)
START-HERE.bat --model IQ2_XS --context 32768 --vision yes --yes     no questions
START-HERE.bat --gguf-dir D:\models\IQ2_XS       use GGUF files you already have
START-HERE.bat --data-dir E:\Strata-data         keep the model files somewhere else
START-HERE.bat --port 8081                      another port
START-HERE.bat --gpu 1                          another GPU (numbered as nvidia-smi; setup picks the one with the most VRAM)
START-HERE.bat --calibrate                      tune the engine for this PC (about 15-30 minutes, longer on a slow card), then start
```

With more than one model installed, it asks which one to start. `run-<model>.bat` starts a model directly.

**Tuning for your PC (`--calibrate`, engine 0.1.19).** Four engine settings depend on the PC more than on the model:
- the share of the experts missing from VRAM that are copied to the GPU instead of computed by the CPU
  (`--pcie-frac`: a fast PCIe link and a slower CPU want more, a laptop's narrower link less);
- how sure the draft layer must be to add another guess to a check (`--spec-min-p`);
- how many CPU threads compute experts (`--pool-workers`: on CPUs with efficiency cores, fewer can be faster);
- how busily the VRAM expert cache follows the conversation (`--adapt-every`, `--adapt-swaps`, `--adapt-decay`): a PC
  whose CPU reads the missed experts slowly (DDR3 or DDR4 in few channels) gains from swapping more. On a Xeon
  E5-2673 v3 with DDR3 and an RTX 4060 Ti on PCIe 3.0 x8, 160 swaps every window measured +7.9% over the default
  (Q2_0, with the swaps taking effect a window later, #764); see #906.

The defaults were measured on a Ryzen 5 7600 with an RTX 5070. Setup offers to measure them on your PC after an
install; `START-HERE.bat --calibrate` (Linux: `./setup.sh --calibrate`) does it any time. It measures the output
speed with each setting and keeps one only when it is more than 3% faster. The result is remembered per PC and model
(in the settings file next to the data folder's record), so updates keep it.

Measuring the worker count needs a fresh engine, so the model is loaded more than once: the PC is busy, and can
stop responding for a minute or two, once per restart. It then starts the model, like a plain `START-HERE.bat`.

**Manual CPU task granularity.** `--pool-tasks N` sets the target total number of row tasks in each batched
CPU expert Gate/Up and Down phase, not the number of threads or tasks per expert. The default `0` keeps
three tasks per participating thread (including the host when enabled). Values `1..4096` are capped by
each phase's row count; native batches larger than the pool's capacity apply the target to each sub-batch.
For example, `--pool-workers 13 --pool-tasks 192` uses 14 participating threads with the default host worker.
More tasks can reduce imbalance between cores, but also add scheduling overhead: compare against `0` with
the same worker count and workload. This does not change kernels, phase barriers, or PCIe placement, and
does not affect the legacy single-token/oracle fallback. Setup's `--calibrate` does not tune it yet.
For the server, add `"--pool-tasks", "192"` to the existing `args` list in its configuration, then restart it.

### Running it at startup (Task Scheduler)

To have the model up at logon, people start the serve from **Task Scheduler** (or a service). Beware: Windows
throttles such contexts, and the model's ~40 GB expert load then crawls at **~0.05 GiB/s (13-14 minutes)**
instead of **~1.4-1.5 GiB/s (~35 seconds)** - a 24x slower start. Measured on an RTX 5070 Ti + Ryzen 7 9800X3D
+ NVMe, same binary, same args, same cache state:

| How the serve starts | Expert load |
| --- | ---: |
| Double-click / terminal / SSH | 1.42-1.52 GiB/s (~35 s) |
| Task Scheduler with its defaults | 0.05 GiB/s (821-841 s) |
| Task Scheduler with the two settings below | 1.42 GiB/s (35 s) |

In the task's properties set both of these (the defaults are the opposite):

- **Priority level: Normal** (Options tab; the default is Below normal), and
- **Run with highest privileges** (General tab; without it the task runs with a limited user token - which
  also strips `SeLockMemoryPrivilege`, the privilege Windows large pages need).

(Both were changed at once, so the isolated effect of each is not measured.) If the model still starts
slowly, the engine prints a hint under its `loaded ... GiB at ...` line naming this cause.

**Large pages need a new logon (#1412).** Granting "Lock pages in memory" (`secpol.msc`, User Rights Assignment) to the account that runs the engine takes effect at the next logon: Windows puts the privilege in the access token when the session starts, so log off and on (or reboot) after granting it. Until then the startup log still says the large pages were refused.

### Chat in the terminal (optional)

```
.venv\Scripts\python chat.py
```

---

## Linux

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The same questions, the same automatic install (it uses `sudo apt` for Python and, only if it has to compile,
for the build tools), and the same start: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Later runs of `./setup.sh` (or `./run-<model>.sh`)
start the model directly. Options as on Windows (`./setup.sh --setup`, `--model Q2_0 --yes`, `--gguf-dir /data/Q2_0`).
Terminal chat: `.venv/bin/python chat.py`.

- **Updating:** `git pull`, then `./setup.sh`: it compiles the engine again when its source changed (a minute or
  two for the changed files). If that compile fails, it says so and starts the engine you had.
- **Other distributions** (Arch, Fedora, ...): install the C++ compiler and the CUDA Toolkit 13 with your package
  manager first (Arch: `sudo pacman -S base-devel cuda`); setup finds `nvcc` on PATH, in `/usr/local/cuda*` and in
  `/opt/cuda*`, and does the rest.
- **WSL** works (Ubuntu 24.04 tested), with one limit: the NVIDIA driver pins only about 1 GB of RAM there, so KV
  streaming (`--kv-resident`) is off and the KV cache stays in VRAM, and the experts are copied to the GPU from
  unpinned RAM (slower prompts than native Linux).

---

## Sharing the GPU with other programs (optional)

By default the model stays loaded until you close Strata. On a PC that also games, renders or runs another model
server, three server options (all off by default; also as keys in `strata-<model>.json`) give the VRAM back:

| Option | Config key | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--idle-unload 600` | `"idle_unload_s": 600` | unload the model after 600 s without requests; the next request loads it again |
| `--min-free-vram-mib 11000` | `"min_free_vram_mib": 11000` | load an unloaded model only when that much VRAM is free (it waits up to 15 s for memory being given back), else answer **503** "the GPU is in use by another program" instead of starting into what a game left (with several GPUs it checks the first one) |
| `--before-load "cmd"` | `"before_load": "cmd"` or `["cmd", "arg"]` | a command run before the model is loaded again, e.g. one that unloads another server's model |

`POST /unload` unloads it now (`409` while a request is running) and `POST /load` loads it ahead of a request (both
with `Content-Type: application/json`, e.g. `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/unload`);
`/health` says `"loaded"`, `/v1/models` lists it as `unloaded` (like llama.cpp's router), `/props` sets
`is_sleeping` and the Monitor shows the state. Unloading ends the engine process - and the image encoder, when images
are on; it is started again first, as at a start - so their VRAM and RAM go straight back. The model files stay in
the OS file cache, so loading again takes seconds while that RAM is not needed elsewhere. Measured on an RTX 5060 Ti
16 GB with Q2_0 in the low-RAM mode: unloading takes ~0.3 s, and a request to an unloaded model answered after
4.6 s (text) or 14.7 s (a picture, image encoder on the CPU).

**Giving part of the VRAM back while it keeps serving (#533, opt-in, one NVIDIA GPU; every request and answer:
[VRAM_ELASTIC.md](VRAM_ELASTIC.md)).** With `"vram_elastic": true`
in the config (the engine flag `--vram-elastic`), the expert cache is allocated in 512 MiB segments
(`"vram_segment_mib"`), and `POST /v1/vram` with `{"reserve_mib": 8000}` shrinks it between requests until that much
VRAM is free for another program; `{"reserve_mib": null}` grows it back towards its full size, keeping the reserve
the engine started with (`--vram-reserve-mib`), and `{"reserve_mib": 0}` takes all of it back. A request that is
running finishes first. The experts of the segments given back are computed on the CPU, like any expert outside the
cache, so answers keep coming, slower; growing back puts the same experts in the same slots. Nothing resizes on its
own. Not with a layer split, the helper caches, `--peer-device` or the resident low-RAM mode. Measured on an RTX 5070
12 GB with Q2_0 (4.8 GiB cache): `{"reserve_mib": 6000}` took 78 ms and freed 4.3 GiB (the cache keeps 0.5 GiB for
the prompt path), decode 44 -> 33 tok/s; growing back took 92 ms and the answers were token for token the ones before
the shrink. Without the flag nothing changes (the same answers as without it).

**Keep what the expert cache learned across restarts (opt-in, engine 0.1.36, #477):** a start fills the GPU's expert
cache from the shipped profile, and the adaptive tier (`--adapt-every`) then moves in the experts your requests use.
With `"expert_profile_save": "expert-profile-learned.bin"` in `strata-<model>.json` the engine saves that as a
profile - the experts in VRAM first, then the routing it counted since the start, then the shipped order - on a
clean exit and every 10 minutes between requests (`"expert_profile_save_every": 5` for another interval, `0` for
exit only), written to a temporary file and renamed, so a crash never leaves half a file. The next start begins from
it instead of the config's `--expert-profile` when it is a profile of the same model (else from the config's, as
before). A relative path is in the Strata folder; one file per model, and a profile per project works the same way
(point the key at another file). The file is a fingerprint of what you used the model for: it stays on your PC.
Without the key nothing is counted or written. Setup rewrites the config when run again: add the key again then.

**The expert cache size is a budget, and on Windows an over-sized one pages instead of failing.** `--expert-cache N`
(`"expert_cache": N`) is `N` times the largest expert blob, and the engine compares it only with the free VRAM it
reads **before** the slots are written. `--expert-cache auto` (the default) sizes from that same figure but **checks
again once the slots are actually written** and shrinks if they do not fit; that second check is auto-only (the loop
breaks on `!auto_cache`). Under WDDM an allocation is not resident until it is touched, and the free figure read
before it can be about a gigabyte too high, and the driver's default sysmem fallback puts an over-committed
allocation in system memory instead of failing - so the start looks normal, the banner still reports the slot count,
and only the speed collapses. The startup line is the tell: `... MiB of VRAM free with everything loaded`, and below
about 256 MiB it adds `LOW: requests may stall; add --vram-reserve-mib N` with the value that would have left room.

Measured on an RTX 4080 SUPER 32 GB, IQ3_S, engine 0.1.39, `--max-context 1048576` (yarn factor 4), fresh
43,969 / 45,670 / 47,956-token prompts with 200 generated each, one engine start per row (the rest of the
configuration is the one in `bench/results/2026-10-04-community-rtx-4080s-iq3s`):

| expert cache | slots | VRAM free at start | decode tok/s |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `--expert-cache 8900` (11,631 slots, 22.07 GiB) | 11,631 | 0 MiB (`LOW`, suggests `--vram-reserve-mib 1212`) | 13.7 / 14.7 |
| `auto` | 11,178 | 217 MiB (`LOW`) | 102.1 / 122.3 |
| `auto` with `--vram-reserve-mib 1500` | 10,766 | 1,075 MiB | 88.9 / 96.5 / 101.4 |
| `--expert-cache 7000` | 9,148 | 4,130 MiB | 94.1 / 97.3 |
| the same 11,631-slot cache at `--max-context 524288` | 11,631 | 299 MiB | 113.2 / 107.9 |

453 slots (0.86 GiB) separate 13.7 from 102 tok/s, and the slower run had the **higher** cache hit rate (91.4 / 94.7%
against 90.4 / 93.9%), so this is not misses: being at 0 MiB free is what costs 7x. Two ways to stay out of it: leave
the cache on `auto`, or keep an explicit size and raise `--vram-reserve-mib`, which the engine deducts **before** it
sizes the cache (700 -> 1000 -> 1500 took the free figure from 217 to 575 to 1,075 MiB and cost about 400 slots).

**Checking it on Windows.** `\GPU Process Memory(<pid>)\Shared Usage` and `Dedicated Usage` (Performance Monitor, or
`Get-Counter`) look like the right instrument, but on this machine they did **not** separate a 13.7 tok/s run from a
102 tok/s one: `Shared` read about 55.5 GB at 262/524K and 62.4 GB at 1M in every run, because it counts the
deliberately pinned memory (the expert arena, 50.3 GB here, plus the pinned K/V, 6.19 -> 12.38 GiB at 1M). The free
line in the log is the reliable tell, and on NVIDIA hardware `CUDA - Sysmem Fallback Policy` set to
`Prefer No Sysmem Fallback` for the engine's executable is the other way to make an over-sized cache fail instead of
paging (not measured here). Reported with the measurements in
[issue #781](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/issues/781).

The same shape appears on a second, smaller card. On a 16 GB RTX 5080 at 786,432, UD-IQ4_XS, INT8 KV, with
`Prefer No Sysmem Fallback` set and an explicit `--expert-cache 4000`, taking `--vram-reserve-mib` down from 770 to 0
grew the cache from 2,782 to 3,115 slots (768 MiB) while the card's used memory moved 129 MiB, the hit rate stayed
flat (59.9% to 63.0%) and decode fell from 40.9 to 16.6 tok/s. Every step there reached READY with 0 MiB free, so
with the fallback off it still starts and degrades instead of failing - the slack left for the rest of the card is
worth more than the extra slots, which is the same ordering measured above (enkynakamura, #781; one 256-token sample
per step, so the upper rows are noisy).

## Using it

The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (change with `--port` in setup, or edit the run script).

| API | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat Completions (stream and non-stream, tools) | `POST /v1/chat/completions` |
| Anthropic Messages (stream and non-stream, tools) | `POST /v1/messages` |
| OpenAI Responses (stream and non-stream, tools; stateless, [below](#the-responses-api-and-codex-cli)) | `POST /v1/responses` |
| Model list / health | `GET /v1/models`, `GET /models`, `GET /health` |
| Model properties | `GET /props` (also accepts `?model=<loaded-model-id>`) |
| What the model is doing right now | `GET /status`, `GET /slots` (busy or idle, with `n_prompt_tokens`; one entry per slot with `--batch`) |
| Save / restore the conversation to a file (session files, below) | `POST /slots/0?action=save\|restore` |
| Everything the Monitor tab shows (engine, live state, last requests, hardware) | `GET /metrics` |
| The same for Prometheus, with vLLM's metric names (asked with `Accept: text/plain` or `?format=prometheus`) | `GET /metrics` |
| The MCP servers, their state and tools ([below](#tools-from-mcp-servers)) | `GET /mcp` |

`GET /metrics` answers a Prometheus scrape (`Accept: text/plain` or `application/openmetrics-text`) in the text
format with vLLM's names - `vllm:num_requests_running` / `_waiting`, `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc`, the token and
request counters, `vllm:prefix_cache_queries_total` / `_hits_total` (prompt tokens read / reused),
`vllm:spec_decode_num_draft_tokens_total` / `_accepted_tokens_total` (the MTP drafts), and the histograms
`vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds`, `vllm:inter_token_latency_seconds` and `vllm:e2e_request_latency_seconds` - so the
dashboards and alerts written for a vLLM server read this one. With an API key, the scraper sends it as a bearer
token. Any other request keeps the JSON.

The JSON's own facts that vLLM has no name for come in the same scrape under `strata:`, named after their JSON key,
so a Monitor-tab panel and a Grafana panel read the same value: `strata:live_state{state="..."}`, `strata:live_tok_s`,
`strata:live_prefill_tok_s_mean`, `strata:live_prompt_read`, `strata:engine_max_context`,
`strata:totals_prompt_seconds_total` / `strata:totals_decode_seconds_total`, `strata:last_hit_rate` and
`strata:last_decode_tok_s` (the last request's), and the hardware - `strata:gpu_util`, `strata:gpu_mem_used_bytes`,
`strata:gpu_mem_total_bytes`, `strata:gpu_temp_celsius`, `strata:gpu_power_watts` (one sample per card, label
`gpu`), `strata:cpu`, `strata:ram_used_bytes`, `strata:ram_total_bytes`. A value the server does not have (no GPU
telemetry, an older engine) has no sample rather than a zero.

Ready to use, in `docs/monitoring/`: `prometheus.yml` (a scrape config, the API key as a bearer token),
`servicemonitor.yaml` (the same for the Prometheus Operator) and `grafana-strata.json`, a Grafana dashboard to
import (it asks for the Prometheus data source): requests running and waiting, tokens per second, time to first
token, time between tokens and request duration (p50 / p95), the prompt cache and MTP draft rates, and the engine's
own panels (state, batch slots, rates, expert cache hit rate, GPU and RAM). Its first row uses only vLLM's names, so
it also reads a vLLM server.

`/models` and `/v1/models` list only the loaded model, with its context limit and input modalities. `/props` exposes the original chat template, context limit, configured generation defaults (shared settings take precedence), model path and engine version when available. Context means the full engine context, not the resident KV window. `n_predict: -1` means no fixed output cap. Unconfigured sampling fields are omitted. `/slots` uses llama.cpp's names: `n_ctx` and `n_prompt_tokens` (the running request's prompt size, kept after it ends: what a front-end's context meter divides by `n_ctx`). `total_slots` in `/props` is the number of `--batch` slots (1 without). `autoload` has no effect; an unknown `model` returns 404. These metadata endpoints and `/slots` require the API key when one is configured. They do not load, unload or restart models.

`chat_template_caps` uses llama.cpp's field names. Strata checks them when loading the active template by rendering
small requests; a rejected or omitted feature is `false`, and a template that fails a probe in any way only turns that
feature off (the server still starts). `supports_tools` checks tool definitions and XML call
instructions; `supports_tool_calls` checks that calls in the history use Strata's XML format and keep tool results.
`supports_parallel_tool_calls` checks multiple calls in one assistant turn, and `supports_system_role` checks a
leading system message. `supports_preserve_reasoning` means older assistant turns keep their `reasoning_content`
in the rendered prompt. It does not describe whether a new reply returns reasoning. These are compatibility hints
for clients, not a guarantee that the model will follow a request. Zed's llama.cpp provider reads this object to
offer tools.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": "strata", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about GPUs."}], "max_tokens": 512 }'
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="none")
r = client.chat.completions.create(model="strata", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
```

- **Thinking levels: none, low, medium, high.** The model thinks before it answers (streamed as
  `reasoning_content`, Anthropic: `thinking` blocks). Choose how much per request - in the chat page (the "Thinking"
  menu), in `chat.py` (`/think low`), or over the API:

  | API | how |
  | --- | --- |
  | OpenAI | `"reasoning_effort": "none" \| "low" \| "medium" \| "high"` (also `"reasoning": {"effort": ...}`, or `"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}`) |
  | Anthropic | `"output_config": {"effort": "low" \| "medium" \| "high"}`, `"thinking": {"type": "disabled"}`, or `"thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}` (under 2K = low, under 8K = medium, more = high) |

  Without a setting the model uses its own default, **high**. `none` answers at once (fastest); `low` keeps the thinking
  short. The levels are instructions the model was trained with, not a hard token limit: on easy questions all three
  think briefly, on hard ones `high` thinks longest and is most accurate.
- **A hard thinking budget (opt-in).** `"reasoning_budget_tokens": N` in a request (OpenAI or Anthropic) caps the
  thinking at N tokens: when it gets there the server ends it with a short wrap-up line and `</think>`, and the model
  answers from there (the engine continues from what it already holds, so nothing is read again). The wrap-up is
  part of the thinking the client sees and counts as output tokens. `"reasoning_budget_tokens": N` in
  `strata-<model>.json` sets it for every request; a request's own value wins, and `0` means no budget. Off by default;
  Anthropic's `"thinking": {"budget_tokens": N}` still only chooses the level, as above.
- **A reply that ends inside its thinking (#1053, opt-in).** Some turns write a sentence of reasoning and then the
  end-of-turn token with no `</think>`: the content is empty and an agent stops. `"reasoning_close_retry": true` in
  `strata-<model>.json` closes the thinking once (as the thinking budget does) and continues, once per request, only for
  a reply that ended that way with no answer and no tool call. Off by default.
- **A reply stuck on one token is ended (0.1.39, #606).** When a reply repeats the same token 256 times in a row, the
  server ends it there with `finish_reason` `"length"` and says so in its window: a model in a loop, or a broken
  state that answers one token forever (#606 saw 36,689 tokens of `!`). `"repeat_stop_tokens": N` in
  `strata-<model>.json` sets the run length; `0` turns it off (for a request that really wants one token many times).
- **Repeated reasoning (opt-in, #728).** The single-token guard above does not see a model that repeats whole
  passages. `"reasoning_loop_recovery"` in `strata-<model>.json` is `false` (the default), `"stop"` or `"recover"`
  (`true` means `"recover"`). Every 512 output tokens, at a complete character and parser boundary, the reasoning is
  measured over its last 2,000 words and punctuation marks (counting passages over the last 30,000 words). If at
  least 25% belong to 12-word passages seen three times, `"stop"` ends the reply there as `"length"` and says so in
  the server window. `"recover"` stops and drains that generation, then goes on once from all its generated token
  ids with the template's low-effort sentence in place of the xhigh one in the first system message (a splice of
  token ids: the rest of the prompt is not decoded or re-encoded). The task stays the same; no answer or `</think>`
  is inserted, and both passes share the original output limit. On recovery only, temperature is raised to at least
  1.0 and presence penalty to at least 1.5; a client's top-p, top-k and seed are never changed. `/metrics` records
  `reasoning_recoveries` and the coverage. This is a policy, not a numerical engine fix or a guarantee of an answer.
  `"recover"` needs the exact xhigh sentence in the first system message and skips requests with images; re-reading
  the changed prefix costs prompt time. Either mode can mistake repeated useful code or checks for a loop, so keep
  the recorded answer quality alongside the completion rate when testing it.
- **Changing the effort without re-reading the prompt (opt-in, 0.1.39, #458).** The effort's instruction is the
  first thing in the prompt, so a request that only changes the effort (an agent's "think harder" switch, `none` for
  a quick tool step) reads the whole conversation again. `"effort_position": "end"` in `strata-<model>.json` renders
  every request's prompt start as the default effort's and puts a `low` / `medium` effort in a short system turn
  right before the answer (no thinking: the empty thinking block, as always); the engine (0.1.39+, which the server
  checks) keeps its checkpoint in front of that turn, so the next request reuses the conversation whatever its
  effort. The default (`"start"`) prompt is unchanged. The model sees a level that is not the default in another
  place than it was trained with; how well it follows it there is not measured yet.
- **Anthropic requests that don't ask for thinking (opt-in, 0.1.32, #278).** By default a `/v1/messages` request
  with no `"thinking"`, effort or budget thinks as the model's template does. `"anthropic_thinking": "on_request"` in
  `strata-<model>.json` renders such a request without thinking - Anthropic's own rule, and what Claude Code's short
  helper calls (a session title in a few dozen tokens) need; its real turns ask for thinking when it is on there.
- **Streaming.** With `"stream": true` everything arrives as it is made: the thinking, the answer, and tool calls
  (the tool's name first, then its arguments piece by piece, like OpenAI and Anthropic do). While the model reads a
  long prompt the stream sends keep-alives, so agents do not time out; the server window prints progress every
  15 s, and `GET /status` says what it is doing (`reading the prompt`, `answering`, tokens so far). Closing the
  connection or pressing stop in your app really stops the model, so the next request starts at once.
- **Tool calls in other forms (opt-in).** `"tool_call_recovery": true` in `strata-<model>.json` reads a call of a
  tool the request declared also when the model writes it as `<parameter=NAME>` instead of `<function=NAME>`, as JSON
  (`{"name": ..., "arguments": ...}`) inside `<tool_call>`, as a `<function=NAME>` block at the start of a line
  without `<tool_call>` (outside code), or as a second call inside the same `<tool_call>` (without the switch the
  second call's parameters merge into the first). Anything else in those forms stays the text it is. Measured on
  1,462 agent turns (Qwen3.8 under Claude Code, from signalnine/q27's drift corpus): 98.3% read as intended with it,
  92.9% without. Off by default, so what a client gets back is unchanged unless you turn it on.
- **Prefill progress in the stream (opt-in).** `"return_progress": true` puts that progress on the stream instead of
  sending only the keep-alive, as one extra field on a chunk with an empty delta: `prompt_progress` with `total`,
  `cache`, `processed` and `time_ms`. Those are llama.cpp's four fields and mean the same there (`time_ms` is the time
  since the prompt started reading, and the work still to do is `(total-cache) - (processed-cache)`), so a client that
  draws a prefill bar for llama.cpp draws one here too. It is off unless the request asks, as it is in llama.cpp.
  The engine says one line per `--prefill` chunk, so that chunk is the step: measured on two RTX 3090s with
  `--prefill auto` (8192 tokens), a 42,131 token prompt read in 15 s sent six of them. A prompt shorter than one chunk
  sends nothing, and that is on purpose: its only line arrives once the prompt is read, because the last tokens go
  through the verify windows rather than the batched path, so it stops up to `--short-read` tokens short of the end.
- **Chat apps.** Any app with an "OpenAI-compatible" provider works: base URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`, any API key.
  Zed's llama.cpp provider reads `/props` and offers tools from `chat_template_caps`. Its generic OpenAI-compatible
  provider does not: add `"capabilities": {"tools": true, "chat_completions": true}` on that model in Zed's settings.
- **OpenCode** (#543). A starting point for `opencode.jsonc` (in your project, or `~/.config/opencode/`); the field
  names are OpenCode's, so check its config docs if your version differs:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    "provider": {
      "strata": {
        "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
        "name": "Strata (local)",
        "options": { "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", "apiKey": "none" },  // or your api_key
        "models": {
          "strata": {
            "name": "Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (Strata)",
            // context: what you chose in setup; output: what one reply may use (prompt + output must fit)
            "limit": { "context": 262144, "output": 32768 },
            "options": { "reasoningEffort": "high" },                  // sent as reasoning_effort
            "variants": {                                              // switch between them in OpenCode
              "low": { "reasoningEffort": "low" },
              "medium": { "reasoningEffort": "medium" },
              "none": { "reasoningEffort": "none" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "model": "strata/strata"
  }
  ```

  Set `limit.context` to the context you chose in setup: OpenCode compacts the conversation before it gets there.
  Keep `limit.output` well under it: a request whose prompt plus `max_tokens` runs past the context is refused (see
  **Context** below), or add `"fit_max_tokens": true` to `strata-<model>.json`. For a hard cap on the thinking, add
  `"reasoning_budget_tokens": N` to `strata-<model>.json` (see above).
- **Claude Code** (Strata 0.1.17 or newer): set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080` and
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` to a Claude model name it knows (it refuses names it doesn't; Strata ignores the name), plus any
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (or your `api_key`, if you set one).
- **Codex CLI** (0.1.39): see [the Responses API](#the-responses-api-and-codex-cli) below.
- **Context.** Chosen in setup (8K-262K). Requests longer than that are refused, never silently cut. A request whose
  `max_tokens` would run past the context is refused too (400); agents that always ask for their full output cap
  can instead get it shortened to the room left: add `"fit_max_tokens": true` to `strata-<model>.json` (or pass
  `--fit-max-tokens` to `serve/server.py`). A prompt that leaves no room at all is still refused.
- **Model aliases** (0.1.32). `"aliases": ["qwen", "local-model"]` in `strata-<model>.json` lists the model under
  those names too in `/v1/models` (each with its own `id`, and in the model's `aliases`), like llama-server's
  `--alias`; a request naming one is answered under that name. Any other name is still served, as before.
- **Model settings in the web page (0.1.39, #564).** The About tab's Model settings card shows and changes a few of
  the keys above in `strata-<model>.json`: the `sampling` defaults (temperature, top_p, top_k, min_p),
  `reasoning_budget_tokens`, `fit_max_tokens`, `anthropic_thinking`, `effort_position`, `aliases`, `idle_unload_s`,
  `lazy_load`, `engine_silence_s`, `api_monitor`, `open_browser` and `--vram-reserve-mib`. An empty field removes the
  key (its default). Every other key of the file stays as it is, the earlier file is kept as
  `strata-<model>.json.bak`, and the model uses the change from its next start. Only Strata's own page can save
  (JSON, the API key when one is set, as for the Chat settings); the network, key, MCP and program keys are not
  editable there.
- **From other devices on your network.** The server listens on your PC only (`127.0.0.1`) unless you say otherwise:
  run setup with `START-HERE.bat --setup --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key some-long-secret` (or add `"host": "0.0.0.0"` and
  `"api_key": "..."` to `strata-<model>.json`). The server window then prints this PC's addresses
  (`from other devices: http://192.168.x.x:8080/`); open that on the other device, or use `.../v1` as an API base URL.
  On Windows the firewall blocks it until you allow it: accept its prompt for Python (private networks), or run
  `New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Strata 8080" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8080 -Action Allow -Profile Private`
  in an admin PowerShell, and make sure the network is set to Private.
- **From the internet.** Put a tunnel in front of it, for example [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/):
  `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8080`. **Set a key first**, or anyone with the link can use your PC:
  add `"api_key": "some-long-secret"` to `strata-<model>.json` (or set the `STRATA_API_KEY` environment variable);
  clients then send it as their API key. Several keys (one per client, so one can be withdrawn alone): separate them
  with commas, `--api-key key1,key2` or `"api_key": "key1,key2"` as llama.cpp does, or give a list,
  `"api_key": ["key1", "key2"]` (the way to use a key that contains a comma); a request passes with any one of them.
  Streamed answers carry `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, so nginx-style proxies pass
  each token on at once. The web app's settings and MCP tools only answer Strata's own page: when you open it through
  a proxy or tunnel whose address differs, add that address, e.g. `"trusted_origins": ["https://strata.example.com"]`.
  With the key set, any `Host` name reaches the server (see Host names below).
- **From web apps in a browser (CORS).** Off by default. `"cors_origins": ["https://chat.example.com"]` lets pages of
  those origins call `/v1/*` from the browser (Open WebUI's direct connections, browser extensions); `["*"]` lets any
  page do it - only sensible with an API key. It never opens `/settings`, `/unload` or the MCP tools.
- **Host names (DNS rebinding).** A web page of another site can point its own name at `127.0.0.1` and then reach
  this server as if it were its own, so without an API key the server answers only requests whose `Host` is a name
  it knows (with a key the check is off: such a page cannot send the key, and tunnels and proxies that pass their
  own name on keep working):
  `localhost` (and `*.localhost`), any IP address (`127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, `192.168.x.x`, ...), the address it
  listens on and, when it listens beyond this PC (`0.0.0.0` or a LAN address), this PC's name (`mypc`, `mypc.local`)
  and `host.docker.internal`; any port. Others get **403** naming the setting, and the server window prints one line
  for each. Reach it under another name (a reverse proxy that keeps the name, a tunnel, a DNS name on your network,
  another container's name for it)? Add the name: `"allowed_hosts": ["strata.example.com"]` in
  `strata-<model>.json` or `STRATA_ALLOWED_HOSTS=strata.example.com` (comma-separated); `".example.com"` allows that
  name and every name below it, and `["*"]` turns the check off (so does setting `api_key`). The hosts of
  `trusted_origins` count as allowed. Requests without a `Host` header (HTTP/1.0 clients) pass.
- **Web pages without an API key.** Without `api_key`, a `POST` to `/v1/*` that carries an `Origin` header (a
  browser page sent it) is answered only for Strata's own page, pages on `localhost` or an allowed host name (any
  port), the origins in `trusted_origins` or `cors_origins`, and browser extensions and desktop apps
  (`chrome-extension://`, `moz-extension://`, `app://`: no web site can send those), and only with a JSON body; any
  other page, and `Origin: null`, gets **403**. Clients that send no `Origin` (curl, the OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs,
  other servers) are not affected. With
  an API key, the key decides. `POST /unload` and `POST /load` take `Content-Type: application/json` from Strata's
  own page (or no `Origin`), like `/settings`. `POST /slots/0?action=save|restore` keeps the Host and API-key checks
  and also takes only JSON from no `Origin`, Strata's own page or a trusted origin - also when an API key is set.

**Conversation cache.** A request that continues a chat reads only the part after what the engine already holds: the
live session, or one of the checkpoints it keeps in RAM (up to 6, ~118 MB each, taken at the start of each new
assistant turn and every 16K prompt tokens). A checkpoint is used only when the prompt starts with exactly its tokens
and pictures. The oldest checkpoint - in practice the end of the system prompt, which every chat of the same client
shares - is kept for good while the rest rotates by least recent use, so a NEW chat that shares that prefix starts
reading after it instead of from token 0. A prompt read from the start is also checkpointed at the end of its system
prompt when that is 2,048 tokens or more (engine 0.1.20; PR #62 + #65), so that root exists for agent clients with long
system prompts and tool lists. Claude Code stamps its system prompt with a billing header that changes on every
request (`cch=...`) and every session (the 4th part of `cc_version=`); the server pins both stamps (to `f`s, as
llama.cpp does), so the system prompt and the tool list in front of it are the same prompt on every turn. Engine options: `--prompt-cache N` (0 = off), `--prompt-cache-every N`,
`--prompt-cache-root N` (0 = no system-prompt checkpoint), `--turn-token ID`.
A one-shot request that no later request continues (a classification call, a probe) can send
`"strata_checkpoint": false` in its body: it saves no checkpoint at its last turn nor every 16K tokens, so what
follows the reused prefix (or the root) is read in one run, and its session is not kept or parked for a next request.
It still starts from a checkpoint it matches, and still saves the system-prompt root when that reaches
`--prompt-cache-root`. Without the field (or with `true`) nothing changes.

**One long document, many questions: a pinned shared prefix (opt-in, 0.1.40.2, [RESEARCH_RUNS.md](RESEARCH_RUNS.md)).**
A request can say where the document ends: `"strata_prefix": {"messages": 1}` (the first message is the document),
`{"message": 0, "chars": 210000}` (the first 210,000 characters of message 0, for a client that sends the document and
the question in one message) or `{"tokens": 12345}`. The engine reads the prompt in two parts there, keeps the checkpoint
at the boundary pinned (retention never evicts it, a parked conversation holding it stays parked, `SAVE` keeps it) and,
when a later question resumes from it, does not park the question it leaves. So the next question starts at the end of
the document, and 20 questions cost one read of it. Without the field the server's checkpoints are where they were: the
last turn's start, the system prompt's end and every `--prompt-cache-every` tokens, so a question that follows a long
document in the same chat re-reads up to 16K tokens of it (55 s at 262K on a Tesla P100). The field is checked against the
prompt's own ids (the prefix is always the longest common start), a prefix that cannot be marked is said in the server's
window and ignored, and a malformed field is a 400. One pinned prefix at a time per engine (a new one replaces it);
it needs `--prompt-cache 3` or more. `tools/research_run.py` runs a document and a question list against a server with and
without it. The engine's own key is `pin=N` on the `GEN` line.

**Multiple conversations (opt-in).** Add `--conversation-cache-mib 8192
--conversation-cache-slots 4` to the engine arguments to park up to four conversations
in a bounded 8 GiB host-RAM cache. This preserves controller/worker histories when
their requests alternate; it does not execute requests concurrently. No client session
ID is required: only exact token/image prefixes with matching steering mode are reused.
The default budget is 0 (disabled); `--prompt-cache 0` also disables parking.
With `--layer-split`, a parked conversation holds one image per stage (each later stage's
session and its share of the conversation checkpoints), every image is validated before
anything is overwritten, and each is restored on its own GPU. Verified on a 4-GPU split:
a 9,276-token conversation restored in 51 ms, and its follow-up decodes exactly the tokens
it decodes when the conversation never left (`tools/parking_test.py`). FP16,
INT8, Q4_0 and identity-layout K8V4 snapshots are supported; the K8V4 draft ring
remains INT8, as in upstream. Windows/HIP and multi-GPU runtime coverage must be
reported separately from Linux/CUDA evidence.

The web page's Monitor tab has a **Conversation cache** card (0.1.39, #596): the parked conversations against the
slots and the RAM budget, how many were parked, restored and evicted, and the last switch (read from the engine's
log), and for every setup how many prompt tokens the cache gave back - in the last request and since the start.
`/metrics` has the same under `"conversation_cache"`.

Snapshots contain running state, checkpoints, used K/V pages, and draft-layer K/V.
They add host RAM, not another model or VRAM allocation. The byte budget also counts
an incoming snapshot during a switch. After a restore, unchanged K/V pages can be
retained for the next parking operation; growth appends storage without copying
the existing pages. Rewinds refresh the affected pages, and running state and
checkpoints are captured again. Retained active K/V counts against the same byte
budget and is discarded before evicting parked entries under memory pressure.
If reserving space for growth would evict another conversation, parking uses a
full capture instead.
Oldest parked entries are evicted first.
Oversized snapshots or host allocation failures fall back to ordinary prompt processing.
`--conversation-cache-min-free-mib N` (default 2560) additionally requires that
physical-RAM headroom remain available: the engine checks before allocation and
again after capture. Unknown telemetry or insufficient RAM skips parking. Windows
uses `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`, Linux uses `MemAvailable`; these are host-level samples,
not a reservation or enforcement of container/job memory limits. An 8 GiB budget
is a cap, not a recommendation for every machine.

The shared snapshot core validates all layers and checkpoints before applying any
state. Invalid entries are discarded; transfer/synchronization failure is fatal
rather than permission to continue with partial state. Indexer spare keys and the
moving spare row are preserved, including checkpoint rewinds.
The engine log reports parking, restoration, bytes, evictions, individual snapshot
sizes and K/V bytes reused during capture. `STRATA_SNAPSHOT_FULL_CAPTURE=1` disables
retention for diagnostic comparisons. Parked snapshots are not
persisted across restarts; the session files below are.

**Session files (disk).** The conversation the engine holds can be saved to a file and restored later, also after a
restart of the same engine version, so a long prompt is not read again. The server exposes the save and restore
requests of llama-server's slot API, for its single slot 0, when started with `--slot-save-path DIR` (also
`"slot_save_path"` in the config); NAME must be a plain file name inside DIR. There is no erase action and the file
format is Strata's own, not llama.cpp's:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/slots/0?action=save"    -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filename": "chat1.bin"}'
# {"id_slot": 0, "filename": "chat1.bin", "n_saved": 63025, "n_written": 1198691396, "timings": {"save_ms": 709.5}}
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/slots/0?action=restore" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filename": "chat1.bin"}'
# {"id_slot": 0, "filename": "chat1.bin", "n_restored": 63025, "n_read": 1198691396, "timings": {"restore_ms": 898.2}}
```

DIR becomes one absolute path at start (`--slot-save-path` relative to the server's working directory, the config's
`slot_save_path` relative to the config's `"cwd"`), created with mode 0700 when missing. It should be private to the
user that runs Strata: the files hold the conversation's token IDs and state, are created with mode 0600 on Linux
(on Windows they inherit the folder's permissions), and nothing deletes them - about 1.2 GB per 63K-token
conversation. Before it writes, a save checks that the disk has room for the whole new file plus
`--session-min-free-mib` (an engine argument, in the config's `args`; default 4096, 0 = no check) - also when it
replaces a file, whose space comes back only after the rename. This is a preflight, not a quota or a reservation.
NAME may
not contain a path, a drive, a stream (`:`), a Windows device name (`NUL`, `CON.bin`, `COM1`...), a control character,
a leading dot or a trailing dot or space.

The request must be `Content-Type: application/json` (else `415`) and come from no browser page, Strata's own or a
trusted origin (another site's `Origin` gets `403`, also with an API key); the Host and API-key checks apply as
everywhere. Errors: `501` without `--slot-save-path` or with parallel requests; `400` for a slot other than 0, an unknown action, a refused
file name, or a file the engine refuses as invalid (not a session file, corrupt, another model or configuration, over
this session's limits; the session is as it was); `404` for a restore of a missing file; `503` while the model is not
loaded, when the RAM to read the file is not there or an allocation failed; `507` when the disk has no room (the
free-space reserve, or the OS reports no space or quota); `500` for any other I/O failure (permissions, read, write,
flush, rename) and when the engine ended (a restore transfer failure, below, an engine that said nothing for
`engine_silence_s`, or one that answered out of protocol) - the next request starts it again. The status follows the
engine's category (`error.kind`: `invalid`, `memory`, `storage`, `io`), never the words of the message. A save that
failed after its new file had replaced the old one says so with `error.published: true` (below). A save or restore waits for the running request
(the same queue), shows in `/status` and counts as activity for the idle unload. A later request whose messages
continue the restored conversation reuses the restored state or its checkpoint; a short tail may be read again (35
tokens in the measurement below). Only the deepest checkpoint is saved, so an edit further back reads more again.
Clients still send their messages (and images): the file holds engine state and token/image identity, not a chat
export. Underneath, `strata --serve` takes `SAVE <path>` and `RESTORE <path>` on stdin between requests and answers
`SAVED <tokens> <bytes> <ms>`, `RESTORED <tokens> <bytes> <ms>`, `SERR <kind> <published 0|1> <reason>` (failed,
the engine and the session as they were) or `FATAL <reason>` (then exits). On the way, `SESSION <done> <total>` follows
every block of the file that moved (at most 16 MiB, the last partial block and a small file included), and
`SWAIT <phase> <seconds>` comes before a step that blocks in one call (`fingerprint`, `capture`, `flush`, `publish`,
`validate`, `transfer`): that step is allowed those seconds - 60 plus one per 4 MiB it concerns, at most 3600 - by the
engine's watchdog and by the server, then it counts as stuck. The next line clears the allowance. The server checks
every line: a malformed or unknown one, counts that are negative or go back, an allowance outside 1..3600 or a time
that is not a finite number end the engine as out of step.

One file holds the running state, the deepest checkpoint, every QSA layer's K/V up to the conversation's length and
the draft layer's K/V. Format v1, little-endian, fixed-width integers, IEEE-754 floats (a big-endian build does not
compile): a 64-byte header (magic `STRSESS\x01`, version u32, header size u32, model fingerprint u64, config
fingerprint u64, payload length u64, two reserved u64 that must be 0, a hash of the first 56 bytes), the payload
(geometry, layer range, cvec flag, the live state, the checkpoints, the K/V layers; every array preceded by its u64
count), the payload hash and the end marker `STRSEND\x01`. The hash is a 64-bit function with xxHash64-style rounds,
not the standard XXH64 stream; it detects accidental corruption and does not authenticate a file: restore only files
this engine wrote. An unknown version is refused; a new format gets a new version number.

A file is bound to the model inputs and to the settings that change what the saved bytes mean. The model fingerprint
samples (size, first and last MiB) every file the engine loads, by its role: the GGUF shards (also
`--native-dense-gguf`, the head shards and `--embd-gguf`), the PLE shard, the pack's index/dense/embedding files and
`native_experts.txt`, every file the expert source resolved - the pack's `experts.bin`, or for a pack read in place each
layer's gate/up/down GGUF as `native_experts.txt` names it, also one outside the CLI shards - and the MTP's files; not
other files in those folders, and not the path, so a moved model folder still matches. A
change in the middle of a file that keeps its size is not seen: do not change model files while their sessions are
kept. The config fingerprint covers the engine version string (another version is refused; two builds of the same version
are not told apart - there is no build hash), CUDA or HIP,
`--kv`, `STRATA_KV_ROT`, `--kv-resident`, `--max-context`, `--mtp-window`, the resolved rope configuration (type,
base, factor, freq scale, original context, the YaRN knobs - the cached K is post-RoPE), the loaded control vector (a
digest of the tables uploaded: every file's content times its exact scale, the mode, the layer range and the
direction) and the arithmetic switches (`--native-*`, `--no-ple`, the A/B arms). Sampling, seeds, draft tuning and
the expert tier are not in it: they change what comes next, not what the saved cells hold.

A save writes a temporary file with a new hidden name beside `path` (created exclusively, never an existing file or
link), flushes it to the disk, renames it over `path` (`MoveFileExW` with write-through on Windows, which promises no transaction
on every filesystem) and, on POSIX, flushes the folder (Windows has no folder flush; the file flush and the
write-through rename are all it does). A save that fails before the rename keeps the old file at `path` and removes
only its own temporary file. Once the rename is done the old file is gone: if the folder flush then fails, the save
fails with `published` set - the new file's bytes are complete and flushed, but its name may not survive a power loss.
A filesystem that cannot flush a folder (`EINVAL`) is not a failure; the engine logs it. A restore opens `path` without following a symbolic link (or a Windows reparse point) and refuses
anything but a regular file with one name; it checks the size, the header, both fingerprints (before the payload is
parsed; the first 16 MiB block, header included, is already read), that the parse's peak (the image, the read buffer, the per-segment overhead) fits in RAM above the parking
floor (`--conversation-cache-min-free-mib`), the file's size against the largest this session can restore, the
geometry and layer range before any state array, and every count against the bytes left and this session's exact
limits (context and cells, checkpoints, layers, each running-state array, each K/V part) before allocating it, the payload hash
and then the usual snapshot validation - all before any device write, and a refusal leaves the current session as it
was. A transfer failure after the device writes began ends the engine (`FATAL`) rather than decode from a partial
state; the server reports `500` and starts it again. A restore does not park the outgoing session. Not supported with
`--layer-split`, `--peer-device`, `--batch` (the config's `"parallel"`, #465; the server answers `501`) or
`--prompt-cache 0` (the RAM conversation cache need not be on). On Linux the file
moves with `O_DIRECT` in 16 MiB blocks when the filesystem takes it (buffered I/O otherwise, or with
`STRATA_SESSION_BUFFERED=1`); on Windows with buffered I/O. The engine has been run on Linux/CUDA only. An earlier
revision's CPU file-I/O test passed as a 32-bit Windows executable under Wine; the current code has not been built
for Windows, and the Windows engine, HIP and AMD cards have not been run.

A session file saves conversation state, not all of the process's execution history. Exact future token replay
across restarts is not guaranteed: expert residency and CPU/GPU rounding can change later output. In a 63K test the
first 32-token continuation after a restore matched the process that kept running; on the next continuation three
restored processes agreed with one another but differed from that process from the 28th token on. A refused,
corrupted restore in between did not change the restored processes' continuation. The cause of this divergence has
not been isolated.

Measured on an RTX 4070 Ti (12 GB), Ryzen 9 5900X, 64 GB RAM, NVMe ext4, IQ3_XXS, a 63,025-token conversation
(engine 0.1.38 with this change, binary sha256 `3bbe4fc3...`): file 1.20 GB, save 0.65 s including the flushes to
disk (10 more saves of the 1.20 GB state after a further turn: 0.59-0.61 s replacing one file, 0.80-1.18 s to new
names), restore 1.05 s in a new engine process, then the next 32-token turn in 1.14 s with the same 32 output tokens as
the same turn without a restart (1.00 s); the cold first turn takes 25.5 s. The save reported 73 `SESSION` lines, never
more than 16 MiB apart. A symbolic link, a second hard link and a file with one flipped payload byte were refused
(the last also while a restored conversation was live, which then went on to answer); a fresh engine with another
`--rope-freq-base` refused the file and then answered; a save with a RAM floor above the machine's RAM was refused as
`memory` before any copy, the file it would have replaced untouched. The times are single runs.

**Current limits (v1):** one request at a time unless `"parallel": N` is set (opt-in batch slots, up to N requests
decoded together: [BATCHING.md](BATCHING.md)), and one conversation cached at a time (switching between two chats
re-reads the other one unless the opt-in cache above is enabled, or each conversation keeps its own batch slot); images only when set up with them (below); no video. **Temperature / top_p / top_k / min_p /
seed** are honored per request (OpenAI and Anthropic fields), and so are stop strings (OpenAI `stop`, a string or up
to 4; Anthropic `stop_sequences`): the answer ends before the first one, which is not sent, and the engine stops
there (`finish_reason` "stop"; `stop_reason` "stop_sequence" with `stop_sequence` set to the one found); with the default adaptive expert tier a sampled result
is not reproducible run to run - for seed-reproducible output add `--adapt-every 100000` (static residency) to the
engine arguments. The run config's optional `sampling` block sets the defaults for requests that leave the fields out
(`"sampling": {"temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 0.95, "top_k": 20}`); a request's own fields always win, and with no
block at all a request without sampling keys decodes greedy. The penalties (`presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`,
`repetition_penalty`, with `penalty_last_n` capping how many recent tokens they count over, default 64 when any
penalty is set) ride the same path; they count the tokens the request has consumed, so a repetition penalty
suppresses what the model itself just said, not the prompt alone. Since engine 0.1.19 they apply to every token
the speculative decoding checks at once, exactly as if it decoded one token at a time (before, only the first of
each batch got them). That makes requests with penalties 1-11% slower than in 0.1.18: the draft layer guesses
without penalties, so more of its guesses are now rejected. Requests without penalties are unchanged. `top_k` keeps at most 64 candidates: `0` ("off") or anything above 64 uses all 64.

**Sampled drafting (opt-in, 0.1.40.2).** With temperature above 0 the engine keeps a draft only when it equals the token the model sampled for that position, and the draft layer proposes its best guess. Two opt-in switches change how the draft layer drafts a sampled request; greedy requests (temperature 0) are never touched and stay byte-identical. `STRATA_SPEC_COUPLED=1` (or `--coupled-draft`) drafts by sampling with the request's own settings and the random number the checking row will use; the text for a seed does not change. `STRATA_SPEC_PROB=1` is speculative rejection sampling: the draft layer samples its guess from its own distribution q, the check accepts it with probability min(1, p/q) (p is the model's distribution after penalties, top_k, top_p, min_p and temperature) and otherwise samples the replacement from the leftover distribution, so every token is distributed exactly as without drafts (the text for a seed then depends on the drafts, so it is reproducible only for the same engine, flags and prompt). Guesses without a distribution (prompt lookup, suffix drafts) keep the exact-match rule, which is already exact. Neither is faster in a way that holds up: on an RTX 3060 (IQ3_XXS, 200-token story and code answers, 10 interleaved pairs) the default's median output speed was 42.4 / 43.2 / 43.3 tok/s at temperature 0.3 / 0.7 / 1.0, coupled drafting 40.6 / 42.4 / 43.3 and rejection sampling 41.0 / 42.6 / 42.6, with run-to-run differences of up to 5% between repeats; drafts kept per round fell at 0.3 and rose by about 5 points at 1.0, which the cost of the longer sampled windows ate. `STRATA_SPEC_DEPTH=1` prints the acceptance by draft depth for each request; `STRATA_SPEC_MIN_TEMP=0.9` limits sampled drafting to hotter requests. Proof that the rejection rule keeps the distribution: `spec_prob_test` (chi-square, 2 million trials per case) and `spec_verify_parity` (GPU against the host reference).

### The Responses API and Codex CLI

`POST /v1/responses` (0.1.39, #451) speaks OpenAI's newer Responses API, which Codex CLI uses (it no longer
speaks Chat Completions). It runs on the same path as `/v1/chat/completions`, so the thinking levels, the thinking
budget, the conversation cache and the same API key, Host and Origin checks apply.

It is **stateless**: nothing is stored, so the client sends the whole conversation in `input` every time (Codex does,
with `store: false`). `previous_response_id`, `conversation`, `background` and the retrieve/delete/cancel endpoints
are refused with an error that says so.

| Request | What Strata does |
| --- | --- |
| `input` as a string, or as items | `message` items (`user`, `assistant`, `system`, `developer`; text and images), `reasoning`, `function_call`, `function_call_output`, `custom_tool_call(_output)` |
| `instructions` | The system message (with leading `developer` messages; later ones become user messages, as on the chat path) |
| `tools` | `function` tools, `namespace` tools (the model sees `namespace.name`; calls come back with `namespace` and `name`), `custom` tools (one free-form `input` string). Hosted tools (`web_search`, `file_search`, ...) are left out: the model cannot run them |
| `tool_choice` | `"none"` hides the tools; anything else lets the model choose (it cannot be forced) |
| `reasoning.effort` | `none`/`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`/`xhigh`; without it the model's default (high) |
| `max_output_tokens` | The output cap (thinking included). Running out ends the response `incomplete` (`max_output_tokens`) |
| `text.format` | `json_schema` and `json_object` use the [JSON response formats](#json-response-formats) (checked, not constrained) |
| `thread_source` `thread_title` in `client_metadata["x-codex-turn-metadata"]` | Codex's thread-title request (opt-in: `"codex_thread_titles": true` in `strata-<model>.json`, off by default), sent beside each user turn from another session with `tools: []`: answered without the engine as `{"title": "<the user's line, cut to 36 characters>"}`, so the conversation keeps the prompt cache. The title is the user's line, not one the model wrote |
| `temperature`, `top_p`, `reasoning_budget_tokens`, ... | As on the chat path |

The model's thinking comes back as a `reasoning` output item with `reasoning_text` content (streamed as
`response.reasoning_text.delta`). This model writes no separate summaries, so `summary` is empty. With
`"include": ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` the item also carries `encrypted_content`: an opaque string (base64, not
encrypted; the client already holds the text). Send the reasoning items back with the rest of the conversation, as
Codex does: their thinking goes back into the prompt, so it matches what the model wrote and the conversation cache
is reused.

With `"stream": true` the events are the official ones, in order: `response.created`, `response.in_progress`, then
for each output item `response.output_item.added`, its deltas (`response.reasoning_text.delta`,
`response.output_text.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.delta`), its `...done` events and
`response.output_item.done`, and at the end `response.completed`, `response.incomplete` or `response.failed`.
While a long prompt is read, a `response.in_progress` event goes out every 15 s, which Codex counts as activity.
Errors before the answer starts have the Responses form (`{"error": {"message", "type", "param", "code"}}`); after
it started they arrive as `response.failed`.

**Codex CLI.** In `~/.codex/config.toml` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml`):

```toml
model = "strata"                        # any name; Strata answers with its model
model_provider = "strata"
model_context_window = 32768            # the context you chose in setup: Codex compacts before it gets there
show_raw_agent_reasoning = true         # show the model's thinking (it writes no summaries)
# model_reasoning_effort = "medium"     # none, low, medium or high; default: the model's (high)

[model_providers.strata]
name = "Strata (local)"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
stream_idle_timeout_ms = 600000         # a first, long prompt can take minutes to read
# env_key = "STRATA_API_KEY"            # only if the server has an api_key: the variable holding it
```

Then run `codex` (or `codex exec "..."`) as usual. Codex warns `Model metadata for ... not found` for a local model
name; that is expected. Measured with Codex CLI 0.160.0 and Q2_0 on an RTX 5070: its first prompt (instructions and
tool descriptions) was 9,443 tokens, read in 10 s; in a tool loop, each later turn reused about 96% of the prompt from
the cache and read only the new part in 1-2 s. On Windows, Codex's sandbox rejected every shell command in that test
until it was started with `-c 'windows.sandbox="unelevated"'` (a Codex setting, not Strata's).

**Codex's compaction (opt-in: `"codex_compaction_cache": true` in `strata-<model>.json`).** When the context fills up (or
on `/compact`), Codex sends the conversation once more with a request to summarize it, and with `tools: []`. The template
writes the tools at the top of the prompt, so that prompt would share only its first few tokens with the conversation the
engine holds and be read again from the start, at its longest. With the option on, Strata keeps which Codex conversation
sent the last prompt other than a compaction (`session_id` and `thread_id` from `client_metadata["x-codex-turn-metadata"]`)
and the tools that prompt was rendered with; a request Codex marks `"request_kind": "compaction"`, from that same
conversation and without tools of its own, is rendered with them. Only the prompt: for the output parser and in the
response the request's tools stay what Codex sent, none, so a tool call the model writes comes back as a plain function
call without its namespace or custom-tool form. It is one entry, replaced by each such prompt; a compaction of another
conversation, a request without that metadata (Codex before 0.140) or a restart renders the request as sent, and so does
one that would not fit the context with the kept tools. Off by default: the prompt of a compaction differs from the
one the client sent. The author measured, with Codex CLI 0.160.0 and an engine that only counts the shared prompt start,
that a compaction after an 85,000-token conversation reused 84,895 of its 84,997 tokens and read 102; without it, 41 of
80,683.

## Tools from MCP servers

The chat page can give the model tools from [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers, as LM Studio and Claude
Desktop do: reading your files, fetching web pages, searching, anything an MCP server offers. List the servers in
`strata-<model>.json` under `"mcp_servers"` - the same shape as Claude Desktop's `mcpServers` block, which you can
also paste as it is (key `"mcpServers"`):

```json
"mcp_servers": {
  "files": {"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "C:\\Users\\me\\Documents\\notes"]},
  "search": {"url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ..."}}
},
"mcp": {"timeout_s": 60, "max_result_chars": 20000, "max_rounds": 8}
```

Or keep them in their own file and start the server with `--mcp-config path\to\claude_desktop_config.json` (a file
with an `mcpServers` block; add it to the `serve/server.py` line of your run script). Restart Strata after a change.

- **A program** (`command`, `args`, optional `env` and `cwd`) is started by Strata and spoken to over its
  stdin/stdout; `npx`, `uvx`, `python` and friends are found on `PATH` as usual (Node.js is needed for `npx`
  servers). **An address** (`url`, optional `headers`) uses MCP's Streamable HTTP transport (the older SSE-only
  transport is not supported). `"disabled": true` leaves an entry out.
- The servers start with Strata, in the background; the server window says what each one offers
  (`MCP server 'files': 14 tools (...)`), or why it did not start - its tools are then left out and the chat works
  without them. The Monitor tab lists them, and the Sampling drawer has **Use tools from MCP servers** (on by
  default). A server that stops later is started again at its next call.
- In the chat each call shows as a small block (tool, arguments, result); the model reads the result and goes on,
  up to `max_rounds` calls in a row per answer. A tool that fails or takes longer than `timeout_s` (default 60 s)
  gives the model an `error: ...` result instead of ending the chat. Results longer than `max_result_chars`
  (default 20,000 characters) are cut, with a note, before the model reads them. Stop stops a running tool too.
- Only the chat page uses them. API clients (omp, Claude Code, OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs) see the API exactly as
  before and keep their own tools; a request to `/v1/chat/completions` opts in with `"strata_mcp": true` (it then
  gets `strata_mcp` tool events in the stream).

**Security.** MCP tools run on your PC with your user's rights, and **the model decides when to call them** - also
because of what it reads (a web page or a file can contain instructions). Give a filesystem server only the folders
it needs, prefer read-only tools, and don't add servers you don't trust. The tools can only be used from the chat
page itself (a request with another site's Origin or without a JSON content type is refused); if Strata is reachable
from other devices, set an API key.

**Context extension past 262K (rope scaling, EXPERIMENTAL, off unless you pick it).** The model was trained on
262,144 positions (rotary base 1e7). Rope scaling rescales the rotation angles so that longer contexts stay usable,
with llama.cpp's types and flag names. `linear` is Position Interpolation: every angle is shrunk by the factor.
`yarn` keeps the high-frequency angles, interpolates the low-frequency ones, and adds the magnitude correction
that keeps the attention temperature where training put it. **Without the flags nothing changes:** an unscaled
run computes exactly what it did before the feature existed, bit for bit. Scaled contexts need proportionally
more VRAM/RAM for the KV cache and the rope tables (~13 KB and ~0.26 KB per token).

What was measured (contributors' runs, RTX 5080 + IQ3_S, native path, in PR #84): per-position perplexity on the
same tokens, with only the scaling flag changed. At 293K tokens (1.12x the trained length), `yarn` with factor 2
lowered the NLL by 0.18 nats against both `none` and `linear` 2 (2.04 vs 2.22 / 2.22). That is 3-4x the path noise
measured at the same length. `linear` 2 was indistinguishable from `none`. At 2.7K and 32K no arm separated from the
noise. Needle tests do not tell the arms apart: the unscaled model also finds a needle at 413K. Long real-document
Q&A worked with `yarn` 2 at 421K and `yarn` 4 at 714K (8/8 each), and a 1M-token `yarn` 4 run read end to end.
Taken together, use **yarn**. It is still experimental: the numbers come from one machine and one quant.

- setup: `START-HERE.bat --setup --context 393216` asks nothing extra - it picks the method (yarn; one
  question when run interactively) and derives the factor from the final context for you (final context /
  262,144, at least 1: 1.5 at 393K, 2 at 512K, 1 inside the trained range; `--rope-scaling`/`--rope-scale`
  override; an explicit `--rope-scale` is kept as given even when it is too small for the context actually
  served, so check it if you set one). An explicit `--rope-scaling none` for a context past
  262,144 is refused: the setup will not configure a run with the stock angles past the trained range. If
  the RAM check reduces a chosen 384K/512K back inside the trained range, an omitted method adds no
  scaling, and an explicitly chosen one stays at factor 1 - the trained angles, no expansion (not a
  switch for rope as a whole: explicitly supplied rope settings keep their behavior).
- engine: `--rope-scaling none|linear|yarn`, `--rope-scale F`, and the raw ggml knobs `--rope-freq-base`,
  `--rope-freq-scale`, `--yarn-orig-ctx` (default 262,144), `--yarn-ext-factor`, `--yarn-attn-factor`,
  `--yarn-beta-fast` (32), `--yarn-beta-slow` (1). The model file's `rope.scaling.*` keys, when a
  fine-tune ships them, are the defaults the flags override.

The scaling is fixed for the whole run - the engine stores keys in its cache after rotating them, so one
cache must never mix two scalings, and there is no per-request form. Within the trained 262,144 a scaled
run is a slightly different model: the rescaled angles, and `yarn`'s magnitude correction, apply at every
position, not only past the trained end. That is why the setup turns scaling on only for a context past
262,144. Pictures read the same scaled table (their (t, h, w) positions feed it). That should work, but it is
unmeasured: all the runs above are text.

## Manage Strata from your AI assistant (MCP server)

`tools/strata_mcp.py` is an MCP server for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Codex and other assistants.
Once it is added, you can ask your assistant "install Strata for this PC", "start Strata" or "is Strata running?".
In Claude Code, add it with:

```bash
claude mcp add strata -- python C:\Users\you\Strata\tools\strata_mcp.py
```

It has eight tools: status (the running model, what is installed, the hardware, a recommended size), the model
list, install, start, stop, logs, a speed test, and connection settings for other apps.

Install runs `setup.py` with `--yes` in the background. Before it downloads anything, it shows the plan and waits
for your OK. Start and stop work like the run scripts and the server's own unload. The MCP server only ends
processes it started itself. It uses only Python's standard library, so it works before `.venv` exists.

The config snippets for every client, the tool arguments and the safety rules are in
[docs/MCP_SERVER.md](MCP_SERVER.md). This is the opposite direction from
[Tools from MCP servers](#tools-from-mcp-servers) above, where the Strata model calls *your* MCP tools.

## Images (vision)

The model has a vision encoder: [`mmproj-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-BF16.gguf`](https://huggingface.co/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF)
(0.9 GB, a 27-layer ViT plus the projector into the language model). It is **optional**: say yes when the setup asks
"Images?", or run it again with `--vision gpu` (or `--vision cpu`). The setup downloads the encoder, builds a small
helper (`strata-vision`, from llama.cpp's `mtmd` library) and adds it to your start script. Nothing else changes.

| Encoder on | Time per picture | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GPU** (recommended) | **0.1-0.5 s** (up to 1,024 image tokens) | ~1.4 GB of VRAM is kept free for it, so the expert cache is smaller: text output is a few % slower (table below) |
| CPU | about 3 s at 300 image tokens on 8 cores (6-13 s on 4 threads); more tokens take longer, in proportion (#767, #625) | nothing on the GPU |

A picture becomes up to 1,024 tokens of the context (a 640x480 photo: 300). The same picture sent again, as chat apps
do on every turn, is encoded only once.

**More image tokens (0.1.39, #625):** `--vision-tokens N` at setup (`START-HERE.bat --setup --vision cpu
--vision-tokens 768`) sets the most tokens a picture becomes - `"max_tokens"` in the `"vision"` section of
`strata-<model>.json`, which you can also edit by hand. More tokens keep more detail (small text, charts, screenshots)
and take longer to encode, on the CPU most of all; a setup run again keeps the value.

**A minimum number of image tokens (0.1.40, #767):** `"min_tokens": N` in the `"vision"` section of
`strata-<model>.json` (edit it by hand; a setup run again keeps it) is passed to the encoder as `--min-tokens N`
(mtmd's `image_min_tokens`): a small picture is scaled up to at least N tokens. llama.cpp's mtmd prints that Qwen-VL
models want at least 1,024 for grounding tasks (pointing, counting small items); the CPU default stays at 300 at most
and no minimum, because a larger minimum changes the image answers and costs encode time (about 3 s at 300 tokens on
8 cores, in proportion to the tokens).

**A Q8_0 encoder (#625):** `"mmproj"` in the `"vision"` section can point to another mmproj file of this model, for
example a Q8_0 one (llama.cpp's `convert_hf_to_gguf.py --mmproj --outtype q8_0` makes one): the encoder's library
reads quantized weights, the file is smaller (590 MiB against 865 MiB for the BF16 one, from `llama-quantize
mmproj-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-BF16.gguf mmproj-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Q8_0.gguf Q8_0`), and on the CPU it uses less RAM
(about 280 MiB less in the encoder) and can encode faster than BF16 at the default 300 tokens. Setup downloads the
BF16 file, and a setup run again keeps a file of your own that still exists. **Recommended for `--vision cpu`.**
Accuracy against BF16, per image token: the cosine of the embeddings is 0.997-0.999 on average (#625's report, with
a community Q8_0 file, at 300, 768 and 1,024 tokens), and 0.9988 and 0.9987 on two pictures with the file made by
the command above (300 tokens; the worst single token 0.94-0.96). Encode time above 768 tokens is the same as BF16's
within about 3%. Numbers on more pictures (charts, small text) are welcome in #625.

**Flash attention on the CPU (#660):** ggml's fast CPU kernel for flash attention needs the encoder's head size (72)
to be a multiple of the vector width: 8 floats with AVX2, which the release builds use, but 16 with AVX-512, which a
build from source gets on a CPU that has it (Zen 4 and newer, some Intel). There ggml falls back to a kernel that is
several times slower and accumulates in FP16, so `strata-vision` turns flash attention off on the CPU when its ggml has
AVX-512 and leaves it at `auto` (on) otherwise; `--flash-attn on|off|auto` overrides that. A 1024x1024 picture
(1,024 image tokens) on a Ryzen 7 7700X, 8 threads, an F16 mmproj, one encode per fresh process:

| Build | Flash attention | Encode | Peak RSS | Output vs FP32 attention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AVX2 (as released) | on (default) | 8.3 / 9.9 s | 1,152 MiB | 1.2% |
| AVX2 | off | 15.2 / 14.0 s | 2,194 MiB | 1.1% |
| AVX-512 (from source) | on | 43.5 s | 1,152 MiB | 26% |
| AVX-512 (from source) | off (default) | 13.3 s | 2,195 MiB | - |

The last column is the relative L2 distance of the embeddings from the AVX-512 run without flash attention; two builds
differ by about 1% anyway.

**A spare GPU for the encoder (0.1.33, #408):** with a card the engine doesn't use, add `"cuda_device": 2` (numbered
like `nvidia-smi`) to the `"vision"` section of `strata-<model>.json`: the encoder then runs on that card alone. Lower
`--vram-reserve-mib` in `"args"` to 700 as well, so the engine's cards keep that VRAM for the expert cache. The
encoder's card needs code in the ready-made encoder (RTX 20/30/40/50).

### Sending a picture

**Terminal chat:** type `/image <path to a picture>`, press Enter, then type your question.

```
you> /image C:\Users\me\Pictures\receipt.jpg
(picture attached: receipt.jpg - now type your question)
you> What is the total on this receipt?
```

**OpenAI API** (an `image_url` part: a `data:` URL, an `http(s)://` URL or a local file path):

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="none")
img = base64.b64encode(open("photo.jpg", "rb").read()).decode()
r = client.chat.completions.create(model="strata", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": [
    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{img}"}},
    {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this picture?"}]}])
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Anthropic API:** an `image` block with a `base64` (or `url`) source, as usual.

JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, WebP, TIFF and AVIF work (the last ones are converted to PNG first; agents such as omp send
WebP). Chat apps with image upload work the same way.

### Speed with images on (4K context, measured)

| Model | Prompt tok/s, images off | Prompt tok/s, images on | Output tok/s, images off | Output tok/s, images on |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 541 | 531 | 90.7 | 86.9 |
| **IQ2_XS** | 468 | 458 | 77.1 | 74.0 |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 411 | 401 | 64.7 | 59.5 |

"Off" is the published setup; "on" runs with the encoder loaded on the GPU and its VRAM kept free, so ~1,000 fewer
experts fit in VRAM and the CPU computes a few more per token: 2-8% slower. For text, turning images on changes
nothing else (the output is bit-identical when the VRAM is the same).

A question about a picture (a 640x480 newspaper page = 300 image tokens, a 328-token prompt; the whole request, encoder
on the GPU, measured through the API):

| Model | Answer ("MEN WALK ON MOON") | Picture encoded | Prompt | Output |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 1.9 s | ~0.1 s | 207 tok/s | 65-73 tok/s |
| **IQ2_XS** | 2.3 s | ~0.1 s | 173 tok/s | 50-60 tok/s |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 2.7 s | ~0.1 s | 144 tok/s | 41-50 tok/s |

(Short prompts run below the 4K prompt speed: a 2,048-token chunk is where the prompt path is efficient. Short answers
run below the long-output speed: the first rounds have no draft yet.)

**How it works inside:** the encoder turns the picture into rows of the same width as the model's word embeddings;
Strata puts them where the prompt has `<|image_pad|>` tokens and gives each one its 2-D position (row and column in the
picture; the model uses interleaved M-RoPE). Answers match llama.cpp's multimodal implementation token for token on our
test images.

---

**Stager waits (0.1.40.2, `STRATA_STAGER_SLEEP`):** the prompt-staging threads sleep while they wait on Linux and spin on Windows, because spinning is a little faster there (a 5070 read an 8K Q2_0 prompt 1.2% faster). `STRATA_STAGER_SLEEP=1` makes Windows sleep too, which is the choice when sharing the machine matters more than speed: on a Ryzen 9 7940HS laptop with an RTX 4070 (IQ3_S, 64K context) sleeping waits read 5,914 and 22,305 token prompts 5-6% slower while the whole-machine CPU use fell from 77-90% to 21-25% (issue #1101, thanks to midhatn). `STRATA_STAGER_SLEEP=0` forces spinning on Linux. The output is the same either way.

**Stager threads for a GGUF read in place (0.1.41, #1353):** a native pack read from its GGUF shards in place (UD-Q4_K_XL, a Q8_0 pack) copies each expert with 32 threads and a 128-deep ring when the bytes are page faults on an SSD. If the shards' pages are already in the page cache (a big-RAM box, a warm start) those copies are memory copies and the same profile ran 4-7x slower than the 4-thread default (a 124K-token Q8 prompt: 57 -> 350-410 tok/s with the default). The engine now checks a sample of the experts with `mincore` at the first prompt (Linux) and takes the RAM profile when 90% or more of their pages are resident, saying so in its log; a cold or partly cached GGUF keeps the SSD profile. `STRATA_STAGER_SSD=1` / `0` forces either profile; `STRATA_STAGER_THREADS` still wins. The bytes copied are the same.

## Short prompts: the CPU shares the experts (on by default on one NVIDIA GPU, `STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE`)

A prompt chunk of a few thousand tokens (an agent's tool result, a test's output, a short follow-up) streams every routed
expert that is not in VRAM over PCIe, while the CPU pool that decodes sits idle and RAM already holds those experts.
`STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE=auto` hands the pool the experts few of the chunk's tokens route to, measures per layer how
long each side takes and gives the CPU the share at which both end together (`STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE=0.4` fixes a
share). `auto` also checks that sharing pays: it times layers with the share and without it (the first ones alternate until three comparisons are in, then one in 29 runs the other way) and shares only while the layers that share are the faster ones. Where sharing is slower (every share was, on an RX 7900 GRE with a Ryzen 7 5700X3D under ROCm, #1282), the experts stay on the GPU apart from those measuring layers. It is off unless you set it, and then the output is byte-identical to the build without it.

**0.1.41: on by default** on CUDA builds with one GPU and no `--batch` slots, for prompt chunks below 1,024 tokens: unset behaves as `auto` with `STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE_MAX=1024`, and the engine prints one line at start saying so. Measured (interleaved whole-engine runs, 8 rounds, medians): 512 tokens -28..-34% and 1,000 tokens -20..-26% prompt time on an RTX 3060, a Tesla P100 and an RTX 5070, 8/8 pairs each; mean KL against the share off 0.004 (max 0.025). The answers can differ slightly from 0.1.40.3. **`STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE=0` turns it off and gives 0.1.40.3's exact bytes.** The layer split, batch slots and AMD (HIP) builds keep it off unless you set the variable; `STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE_MAX=3072` (the extension to larger chunks) also stays opt-in: it lost 2% at 2,048 tokens on the 5070.

With it on, chunks below 3,072 tokens are staged after their routing (only those can hand the CPU a share) instead of
streaming every expert from 1,024 tokens on; `STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE_MAX=1024` keeps the old limit. The CPU takes
experts it reads from RAM as they are: the arena, the page-locked copy of the resident RAM mode, or the mapped
`experts.bin`'s pages in the file cache (`--mmap-experts`), not only page-locked ones. Serve without `--batch`; on a
layer split every stage has the pool and one stage at a time takes it for a chunk.

When on, the CPU's rows are computed in the CPU's own activation format, so the output changes in the last bits (first
token KL against off: mean 0.006, max 0.026 nats over 22 prompts; about half of the 32-token greedy answers on 500 and
1,000-token prompts are identical, the rest part at a near tie after about 23 tokens). Chunks of 3,072 tokens and more
read the same either way.

Prompt time, medians of 10 interleaved pairs (off / auto, ms, `--expert-cache 1500`):

| machine | 512 tokens | 1,000 tokens | 2K / 4K / 16K |
|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 5070, Ryzen 5 7600, Q2_0 | 1,376 / 1,019 (-26%) | 1,788 / 1,392 (-22%) | unchanged |
| RTX 3060, Core Ultra 7 265, IQ3_XXS | 1,620 / 1,159 (-28%) | 2,196 / 1,770 (-19%) | unchanged |
| Tesla P100, Xeon E5-2690 v4, IQ3_XXS | 4,805 / 3,126 (-35%) | 6,821 / 5,085 (-25%) | unchanged |

Up to 3,072 tokens and with mapped experts, fresh prompts read after an 8K prewarm, medians of 5 interleaved rounds
(off / auto, ms; Ryzen 9 5900XT, 96 GB DDR4-3200, Windows 11, `--mmap-experts`, q4_0 KV; before this the share took no
expert here: none was page-locked):

| machine | 512 tokens | 1,000 tokens | 2,000 tokens | 3,000 tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 5070 Ti (PCIe 3.0 x8), Swift 1.5 IQ3_XXS (huihui-ai's build) | 3,322 / 1,706 (-49%) | 3,990 / 2,357 (-41%) | 5,413 / 3,354 (-38%) | 5,525 / 4,309 (-22%) |
| RTX 3060 + RTX 5070 Ti (layers 0-11 / 12-47, both PCIe 3.0 x8), IQ3_S | 3,452 / 2,037 (-41%) | 4,506 / 2,680 (-41%) | 6,376 / 3,869 (-39%) | 6,733 / 5,138 (-24%) |

A coding agent's recorded conversation on the two cards (a 100K-token start, then 8 turns of 1-5K tokens of code, 128
tokens written a turn, the same tokens read by both): 137.4 s off, 130.6 s auto (reading 121.1 -> 114.3 s).

## More opt-in switches measured for 0.1.41 (all off unless you set them)

None of these changes the default answers; each was measured against the default with interleaved off/on pairs of whole
engine runs (a fresh engine per side, warmed, 200-token greedy answers on three fixed prompts, medians; "pairs faster" counts
the pairs in which the switched arm won). They are here so you can try them on your own card.

- **`STRATA_GDN_CHUNKED=1`: the DeltaNet recurrence of the prompt in chunks of 32 tokens** (sergiywith, #1372; WY form, FP32,
  other bits than the default: first-token KL against the default was 0.002-0.009 nats on average, the same top token in
  every prompt tried). The kernel needs 128 SMs in one wave, so by itself it runs only on a card with 128 or more
  (RTX 5090: 1.8x on the recurrence). On smaller cards `STRATA_GDN_CHUNKED=2` forces it for a measurement, and it is
  slower there: 0.73x on an RTX 3060 (28 SMs) and 0.87x on an RTX 5070 (48 SMs) at 2K-32K tokens (`gdn_rec_parity --bench`),
  and the prompt time did not improve: RTX 5070 2K 1.01x, 8K 1.00x of the default's time; RTX 3060 2K, 8K, 16K 1.01x, no pair faster.
- **`STRATA_FS_SLOTS=N`: the Foresight swap space** (q8atnight, #1348): N VRAM slots per layer, refilled on a copy stream
  with the experts that just missed and with the ones the next layer's router predicts (`STRATA_FS_AHEAD=0` for the
  misses only), so that an expert the cache lacks can be computed on the GPU instead of by the CPU. The model's own router
  decides everything; the slots only hold copies of the same bytes (`STRATA_FS_VERIFY=1` reads every landed slot back and
  compares it: 0 bad in 2,300+ reads on an RTX 5070). The slots are taken from the VRAM the expert cache would have
  (raise `--vram-reserve-mib` by about N x 80 MiB), and in every box measured the smaller cache cost more than the slots
  returned: decode 4 slots, median tok/s B/A (pairs faster): RTX 3060 0.95 (0/6) with misses only, 0.91 (0/6) with the
  look-ahead; Tesla P100 0.97 (2/6) and 1.00 (4/6); 16 slots on the P100 0.96 (0/6); RTX 5070 0.98 (1/6). The reporter
  measured the same on 2x RTX 3090 (the misses per layer are below one there, so the CPU round trip stays). Left off.
- **`STRATA_STAGE_PIN`: pinned stage buffers** (Zhong Uncle, #1237; **opt-in, `STRATA_STAGE_PIN=1`**. It was on by default in
  development, but the 0.1.41 release gate found IQ3_S decode corrupted after a 4096-token prompt with it on, likely a stage
  buffer recycled before its asynchronous copy finished; it stays off until that is fixed). Where the experts are served from the GGUF in
  place (`--mmap-experts`, or too little RAM for the arena) the buffers the cache fill copies from are page-locked, so the
  copy no longer goes through the driver's bounce buffer (about 0.4-0.6 GiB of pinned RAM, one buffer falls back to
  pageable when the driver refuses). Decode, median tok/s on, off, 6 pairs of whole runs: Tesla P100 with the RAM capped at
  24 GB (cgroup) 13.9 -> 15.0 (+8%, 6/6 pairs faster); RTX 5070 `--mmap-experts` +1.2% (5/6); RTX 3060 `--mmap-experts`
  -0.1% (5/6). Boxes that hold all experts in RAM never use the stage buffers.
- **`STRATA_ADAPT_LAG=2`: the adaptive tier's copies are waited for one window later** (#764). Decode, 6 pairs: Tesla P100
  (PCIe 3.0 x16) +3.5% (6/6 pairs faster), RTX 5070 +0.2% (4/6), RTX 3060 -1.3% (0/6), so it stays opt-in.

## Experimental speed projection (EXPERIMENTAL, off by default)

**This is an experiment, not a finished feature.** It ships with Strata but stays off unless you turn it on.

A 480 KB control vector for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`data/experimental-speed-projection/`, see its README). After each
of layers 4-44 the engine removes one direction from every hyper-connection stream of the residual: `h -= (h . v) v`,
one unit vector `v` per layer, exactly as llama.cpp does with the package's `--cvec-mode project` patches.

**What it changes.** The vector's own package describes it as a **refusal-direction projection**: with it the model
declines far fewer requests (it reports 1 of 50 vs 50 of 50 on its test set), and removing refusals removes a safety
behaviour - you are responsible for what the model writes with it on. It also shifts ordinary answers a little
(measured below). It is not an optimization in the engine: on the same text it costs 0.2-0.4% per token. What a
chat's tokens/s does with it on depends on the text the model writes (length, repetition, how well the drafts land),
so measure it on your own prompts; the Monitor marks every request ESP or stock.

**Turning it on (at setup).** `START-HERE.bat --setup` asks "Turn on the experimental speed projection?" (default:
no), or pass `--experimental-speed-projection on` (`off`, or a path to another vector GGUF). Only for the original
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, not Swift 1.5. It writes these engine flags (llama.cpp's) into `strata-<model>.json`:

```
--control-vector-scaled <Strata>\data\experimental-speed-projection\Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-experimental-speed-projection.gguf:1.0
--control-vector-layer-range 4 44 --cvec-mode project --cvec-dir per-layer
```

The engine log then says `control vector mode = project, dir = per-layer, layers 4..44 (41 steered)`, and the web
app's About tab lists it. (`--cvec-mode add` is llama.cpp's stock additive mode, for additive vectors.)

**Per request.** A loaded vector is on for every request unless it says otherwise: the web app's Sampling drawer has
a switch, and the API takes `"experimental_speed_projection": false` in the request body (OpenAI and Anthropic; a
config default goes in `"sampling": {"experimental_speed_projection": false}`). Switching drops the conversation
cache once, since the model state was computed the other way. Switched off, the output is token-for-token the stock
model's.

**Measured here** (Q2_0, fixed experts, 2,557 teacher-forced tokens of code, a document and a chat): the top-1 token
changes at 10% of positions, mean KL from the stock model 0.063 nats (max 4.1), perplexity +15% on code, +2.3% on
the document, +0.4% on the chat. Details: `bench/results/2026-09-27-esp/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `the NVIDIA driver is too old` | Update the driver (NVIDIA App or nvidia.com/drivers), restart, run `START-HERE.bat` again. |
| Python or the build tools could not be installed | Install what it names (links are printed), then run it again. Everything already done is kept. |
| `port 8080 is already in use` | Strata is already running (look for its window), or another program uses the port: `START-HERE.bat --port 8081`. |
| `cudaHostRegister ... out of memory` in the log | Normal on Windows: the engine pins the experts in per-layer slices instead. Only a problem if the load then fails. |
| `ExpertCache: cudaMalloc(...) failed: out of memory` although VRAM is free | Windows' page file is off or tiny: every allocation on the graphics card is also charged to Windows' commit (RAM + page file). Set the page file to "System managed" (System > About > Advanced system settings > Performance > Advanced > Virtual memory) and restart. Since 0.1.19 the engine retries with a smaller cache instead of stopping, and setup warns about a page file under 4 GB (issue #60). |
| The first start takes minutes | It is reading 34-55 GB into RAM; the second start is faster while the files are in the OS cache. |
| The PC freezes for a few minutes at the start | Normal, most of all the first time (the server window says when it happens): the engine loads the experts into RAM, pins part of it for the GPU and sizes the expert cache. Wait; don't close the window. Still frozen after 10 minutes: restart the PC, close other programs, try again, or pick a smaller size. |
| `the engine stopped unexpectedly (exit code ...)` | The engine process ended mid-answer - usually out of RAM (Linux ends the biggest program: `sudo dmesg \| grep -i -E 'killed process\|out of memory'`). The next request starts it again by itself. If it repeats: close other programs or pick a smaller size. The server also warns at start when the model's experts leave less than ~6 GB of RAM for everything else. |
| Slow output, disk light busy | Not enough free RAM: close other programs, or choose Q2_0 / IQ2_XS. |
| `prompt ... exceeds the context` | The request is longer than the context you chose: run setup again with a bigger `--context`. |
| `the setup refuses --rope-scaling none for a past-trained context` | A context past the trained 262,144 needs the rotary angles rescaled (experimental rope scaling), and the setup will not configure one with the stock angles there. Let it pick (`START-HERE.bat --setup --context 393216` adds yarn and a covering factor), or pass `--rope-scaling linear` or `yarn` yourself. |
| Slower than the tables | The monitor plugged into the GPU and other GPU programs take VRAM from the expert cache; RAM running below its rated speed (enable EXPO/XMP in the BIOS) slows the CPU half. |
| `this server was started without the vision encoder` | The model was set up for text only: run setup again with `--vision gpu`. |
| Setup puts the model on an old drive after you moved or reinstalled Strata (#1070) | Setup remembers the data folder you used last in its settings file (`%APPDATA%\Strata\settings.json` on Windows, `~/.config/strata/settings.json` on Linux; the `data_dir` entry) and uses it again. Choose another place with `--data-dir DIR` (model files, packs, MTP layer) or `--models-dir DIR` (the GGUF files only), or delete the `data_dir` line; `--gguf-dir DIR` uses GGUF files you already have without copying. To move a model, copy its folder and run setup with the new `--data-dir`. |
| A picture is refused or `cannot read the image` | The file is not a picture Pillow can open (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP, TIFF, AVIF work). |
| Pictures are slow (3-30 s) | The encoder runs on the CPU: run setup again with `--vision gpu` (needs ~1.4 GB of VRAM). |
| A request never finishes: "reading the prompt", GPU "100%" at low power | The GPU ran out of VRAM (engines before 0.1.9 could end with ~30 MiB free at large contexts). Run `START-HERE.bat` once to get engine 0.1.9 or newer; the log then says `... MiB of VRAM free with everything loaded` (a few hundred) and names the `--vram-reserve-mib` to add if it is low. |
| Output much slower than the tables above, only with a large `--context`, and the start says a small `... MiB of VRAM free with everything loaded` | The expert cache does not fit the card at that context. With `--expert-cache auto` the engine shrinks it to fit; with a fixed number it does not check again after the slots are written, and on Windows the extra is put in system memory instead of failing, so only the speed shows it. Use `auto`, a smaller number, or raise `--vram-reserve-mib` (it is deducted before the cache is sized). See "The expert cache size is a budget" under Sharing the GPU. |
| Generation stops mid-answer, GPU "100%", one CPU core busy | Fixed in engine 0.1.12 (issue #29, a race in the CPU expert pool on big-VRAM cards). Since then a request that stops moving ends with an error instead of hanging (after 2 minutes; 1 minute from 0.1.13): the log says `no progress for ... s ... (issue #29)` with where it stopped, and the next request starts the engine again. If you see that line, please open an issue with it. Engine 0.1.13 adds a stall report under it (what every expert-pool thread and the GPU handshake were doing, memory and page faults) and, on Windows, a `strata-stall-<pid>.dmp` file with every thread's stack: attach both. (`STRATA_WATCHDOG_S` sets the time in seconds; 0 turns it off.) Engine 0.1.14 fixes the stall those reports found (issue #31: with the IQ packs the host could wait forever inside the NVIDIA driver while copying experts in a verify window; the experts are now copied by a GPU kernel, `--pcie-mode dma` restores the old way). |
| `no progress for 60 s ... reading the prompt` on Linux, and the stall report says `threads waiting on the disk (state D): 16 ...` | The engine waits for the drive, not a deadlock: the n-gram table is read at random (`--ple-io direct`), which a rotational disk cannot keep up with (#605). The engine warns at start when the table is on one; `--ple-io ram` (Linux, needs RAM for the table) or the model on an SSD fixes it. Setup adds `--ple-io ram` itself on a rotational disk when the RAM holds the table (0.1.39). |
| `the engine said nothing for ... s during the request` or `... did not finish the request after it was stopped (STOP)` | Issue #481: the engine and the server lost step (the engine waits for its next command, the server for the request's end; GPU at 0 %, nothing in the log). The server ends the engine after 300 s without a line from it during a request (while a prompt is read: each chunk may take three times the previous one's time, the first one up to its tokens at 50 tok/s more), the request ends with an error and the next request starts the engine again. `"engine_silence_s": 600` in `strata-<model>.json` sets the time (0 = wait forever, as before). If you see it, please add the end of the engine log to #481. |
| `the engine said nothing for ... s and used no CPU or disk in that time (frozen ...)` | Issue #1317: a quicker version of the check above for an engine that is not slow but stopped (a deadlock inside a CUDA call, a driver stall): after 90 s without a line, if the engine process has also used no CPU time and moved no disk bytes in that time, the server ends it and the next request starts it again. An engine that is silent but still working is never ended by this check, the server prints one note (`... but is still working; it is not ended`) and leaves it to `engine_silence_s`. `STRATA_ENGINE_STALL_S=180` sets the time, `0` turns the check off (it needs `psutil`, which setup installs). |
| `out of memory: cudaFuncSetAttribute` in the log (IQ3_XXS, long prompt) | Fixed in engine 0.1.15: CUDA loaded a kernel's code when it was first needed, and mid-prompt there was no VRAM left for it. Run `START-HERE.bat` (Windows) or `./setup.sh` (Linux) once to update. |
| Anything else | The engine log is `strata-<model>.log` in this folder. |

## How it works

<p align="center"><img src="paper/tiers.svg" width="760" alt="memory tiers"></p>

- **GPU (VRAM):** attention and DeltaNet mixers, the gated-residual weights, routers, shared experts, output head, the MTP
  draft layer, the KV cache (from 64K: only its most-read part, the rest streams from RAM), and an **expert cache** that fills the rest of VRAM with the most-used experts (it adapts to
  the conversation while you chat).
- **RAM:** all 24,576 experts, pinned. The CPU computes the experts that are not on the GPU **in place**, at the same time
  as the GPU works on the cached ones (AVX-512 / AVX2 kernels, ggml's for the i-quants).
- **SSD:** the 28.8 GB n-gram table, a few rows per token, read unbuffered past the OS cache (`--ple-io direct`, the
  default, made for SSDs; on a rotational disk `--ple-io ram` keeps the table in RAM, #605). The engine reads the table
  in the format the GGUF has it: IQ4_NL (the default table), Q4_0, Q5_0, Q5_1, Q8_0, FP8 (E4M3 with a scale) or BF16.
  Measured on 4,000 random rows against the checkpoint's own BF16 table, the mean per-row error is Q8_0 0.53%, FP8 2.64%,
  Q5_1 3.78%, Q5_0 4.25%, IQ4_NL 7.60%, Q4_1 7.80%, Q4_0 8.55% (a Q8_0 table is 54 GB, an IQ4_NL one 28.8 GB). On the Q2_0 model, 700 teacher-forced tokens, the mean KL against the BF16 table is 0.0117 (Q5_0), 0.0121 (Q5_1), 0.0125
  (Q8_0), 0.0128 (FP8), 0.0140 (Q4_0) and 0.0146 (IQ4_NL), with the perplexity within 1% of BF16's either way: any change to the
  table moves the 2-bit model by about 0.012, so the formats are hard to tell apart. Setup does not offer another table;
  it only changes which GGUF the engine is given.
- **Speculation:** the model's own MTP layer drafts up to 3 tokens; one pass over all 48 layers checks them. 2.4-3.2
  tokens per pass on average. When the reply repeats the context (code edits, quoted text), **prompt lookup** (engine
  0.1.7) drafts up to 5 tokens from the earlier copy, but only where its measured acceptance and cost say it pays:
  code edits 6-11% faster, other text unchanged. The drafts are checked like the MTP's, so the output is the same.
- **Prompts** are processed in chunks of up to 8,192 tokens (`--prefill auto`; 32,768 opt-in) with the experts
  streamed to the GPU over PCIe. Since engine 0.1.39b (#583) the streamed ring is sized in bytes for the pack (a
  native pack with bigger blobs gets fewer ring slots and keeps more cache slots) and `--prefill auto` picks the
  largest chunk that keeps that ring full. It only gives up ring slots where 0.1.39's rule held the chunk at 4,096
  tokens or less; from 6,144 on it keeps 0.1.39's ring and only looks for a bigger chunk beside it (shrinking the
  ring there measured slower: the Coder -12%), and a prompt that fits 0.1.39's chunk keeps 0.1.39's ring (one
  chunk: a smaller ring only slowed it). RTX 5070, 32K prompts against `STRATA_RING_BYTES=0`, 2-3 interleaved
  rounds: IQ3_XXS +18.5% at a 1,500-slot cache and +9% in another memory state, the Coder +3%, IQ3_S unchanged; 4K
  prompts unchanged (-0.7% to +1.1%, bit-identical). Q2_0 (a fixed `--prefill 2048`) is not affected. It changes
  the bits of a long prompt against 0.1.39 (the experts go through a different
  mix of cached and streamed groups). Measured quality, teacher-forced over the next 2,001 tokens of a long document
  against the FP16 prompt path (IQ3_XXS, `--prefill auto`): 8K prompt KL 0.042 (0.1.39: 0.054), top-1 agreement
  93.5% (92.2%); 32K prompt KL 0.020 (0.019), top-1 95.3% (95.0%) - the same band as before. `STRATA_RING_BYTES=0`
  restores 0.1.39's ring, loan and chunk choice.

### Start the API without loading the model

`serve/server.py --engine strata --config strata-<model>.json --lazy` (or `"lazy_load": true` in that
config) starts the lightweight HTTP API without starting the native engine or the vision encoder. The first
generation request, or `POST /load`, starts the vision encoder first when configured, then loads the engine through
the existing reload path, including `before_load` and `min_free_vram_mib`. This also works with image requests:
the load finishes before Strata encodes the image. `POST /unload` stops both processes. Eager startup remains the
default.

`POST /v1/load` and `/v1/unload` are JSON control aliases for integrations, accepting `{}` or
`{"model":"<configured model>"}` and returning model status. They require the configured API key,
`application/json`, and no foreign browser Origin. They return **409** while a request is active or queued,
and **404** for an unknown model. Existing `/load` and `/unload` behavior is preserved. `/api/health` aliases
`/health`; `/v1/status` exposes `loaded` and `auto_load`. The unloaded model remains discoverable.

Unloading and shutdown close the native engine's stdin after sending `QUIT`, allowing Windows' detached
stdin reader to see EOF. Cleanup waits for process exit before releasing handles; if forced shutdown still
times out, the server keeps ownership and reports an error rather than claiming the model was unloaded.

### JSON response formats

`POST /v1/chat/completions` accepts `response_format: {"type":"json_object"}` or
`{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"answer","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"answer":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["answer"],"additionalProperties":false}}}`.
The schema must accept only JSON objects at its root: `"type":"object"`, or an `anyOf`/`oneOf` whose branches are all
object schemas (an `allOf` with an object member, or a local `$ref` to one, also counts), as apps written for
llama.cpp's `json_schema` send. A root that also allows an array, string, number, boolean or null is refused. Local
`#` references work; remote references are refused.
`json_schema` is checked with the Python package `jsonschema` when it is installed (`python -m pip install
"jsonschema>=4.23,<5"`; setup does not add it); without it the answer is only checked to be one JSON object, and the
server says so once.

This is **schema prompting followed by server validation**, not grammar-constrained decoding. One generation
is made per request, with no hidden retry. Successful responses contain a validated JSON object. Malformed JSON,
duplicate keys, non-finite numbers, schema violations and incomplete generations return **502** with
`error.code: structured_output_failed`; invalid request schemas return **400**. JSON formats combined with
tools/MCP are refused explicitly. Without `response_format`, ordinary text and tool behavior stays the same.

Structured SSE buffers the answer while sending keep-alive comments. It emits content only after validation,
then usage/timings and `[DONE]`; failures emit an SSE error and `[DONE]` without invalid content deltas.
`/v1/status.structured_output` advertises the formats, validation method and buffered streaming behavior.

### API request monitor

Off by default, since it keeps prompts and answers in memory: turn it on with `"api_monitor": true` in
`strata-<model>.json` (or `serve/server.py --api-monitor`); otherwise nothing is recorded and the two endpoints below
answer 404.
Open `/api-monitor` to inspect API traffic without opening a chat. It shows the model state, safe
load/unload controls, active/queued requests, original request bodies, output, separate reasoning and
non-stream response bodies. Total wall-clock includes FIFO waits and automatic loading; load, queue,
first-token, prompt/output tokens and engine decode timing are shown separately.

`GET /api/requests` returns compact summaries; `GET /api/requests?id=<id>` returns one retained request.
Both use the existing API-key check. The monitor retains the newest **100 requests in memory** until restart,
with **262,144 characters per input/output/reasoning/response field** and visible truncation flags. The actual API
responses are unaffected. Headers are not recorded, and the monitor key is kept in this tab's session storage.
Treat request history as sensitive input/output when exposing Strata on a network: set an API key as above.
The page uses relative URLs and works through the existing host binding or a reverse proxy.

### Prompt buffers: `bo` shares `emb` (#1454)

The prompt path's half-output buffer `bo` reuses the embedding buffer `emb`, which is dead after the first hyper-connection broadcast: T x 2560 floats less VRAM per chunk (320 MiB at 32768 rows). The planner still counts those bytes by default, so the auto chunk and the cache slots the prompt path borrows are exactly those of 0.1.40.3 and the output bits are unchanged. `STRATA_EMB_REUSE_ACCOUNT=1` lets the planner use the saved bytes: where VRAM limits the chunk it grows (RTX 3060, IQ3_XXS: 6400 to 6656 tokens, 1652 to 1670 borrowed slots, prompt about +3.9%). A different chunk changes the prompt path's rounding, so prompt residuals are not byte-identical to the default; greedy output matched in our runs. Opt-in until it has a KL measurement.
