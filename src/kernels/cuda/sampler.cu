// src/kernels/cuda/sampler.cu - P2.S2: the sampler chain, in llama.cpp's order.
//
//     penalties -> top_k -> top_p -> min_p -> temperature -> pick
//
// THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE CONTENT OF THIS FILE.  llama.cpp builds its chain by walking `params.samplers`, whose
// default is { PENALTIES, DRY, TOP_N_SIGMA, TOP_K, TYPICAL_P, TOP_P, MIN_P, XTC, TEMPERATURE } (`common/common.h`
// at 3cf03257) - ONE penalties stage, first, and TEMPERATURE AFTER THE TRUNCATION FILTERS.  (Issue #53: this file
// used to apply the penalties a second time after the temperature, and min_p before top_p - both taken from the
// order of the `case` labels in `common/sampling.cpp`, which is not the order the chain runs.)  Every order
// produces a valid token, so only a comparison at the distribution level can tell them apart; the parity test
// does that against an independently computed distribution.
//
// `sampler_greedy_kernel` is the plain argmax, one block per token over the vocabulary (on sm_90+ without penalties,
// `sampler_greedy_cluster_kernel`: the same token from a cluster of 8 CTAs per row).  The sampled chain has
// three implementations that pick the same token, bit for bit:
//   - the SPLIT top_k (default): `sampler_split_part_kernel` cuts each row into 4,096-logit blocks over the whole
//     GPU, each keeps its own top_k, and `sampler_split_merge_kernel` merges those lists and runs the tail;
//   - `sampler_one_block_kernel` (`STRATA_SAMPLER_ONE_BLOCK=1`, and the fallback when the split cannot run): one
//     block per token, `top_k` block-argmax rounds, each over the logits after the previous pick;
//   - `sampler_kernel` (`STRATA_OLD_SAMPLER=1`), the kernel of engine 0.1.20, kept as the reference.
// The two new ones share `sampled_tail_warp` (top_p / min_p / temperature / draw on one warp).
