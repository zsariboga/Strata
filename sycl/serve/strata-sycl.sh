# strata-sycl.sh: the SYCL-built engine as a drop-in `exe` for serve/server.py (--engine strata). The port's binary
# needs the oneAPI runtime of the dev image, so this runs it there with stdin/stdout attached (the serve protocol is
# lines on those pipes) and stderr going to the server's log. Paths in the config's args are the container's:
# the data root is mounted at /work.
#   STRATA_SYCL_ROOT   host directory mounted at /work        (default: two levels above this script's repo)
#   STRATA_SYCL_IMAGE  the runtime image                      (default: strata-sycl-dev)
#   STRATA_SYCL_BIN    the engine binary, relative to the repo (default: build-sycl-aot/strata)
#   STRATA_SYCL_NAME   the container's name                   (default: strata-sycl-serve)
# Passed into the container: every variable of this script's environment that starts with STRATA_ (the config's
# "env" block arrives that way: the server puts it in the engine's environment), ONEAPI_ (level_zero:* for a
# two-card split, #423), UR_, IGC_, SYCL_ or ZES_. The port's own defaults (below) are overridden the same way,
# e.g. "env": {"STRATA_VERIFY_NO_HOST": "0"} in the config.
