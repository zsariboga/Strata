"""Tune the engine's hardware-dependent settings on this PC (setup's --calibrate).

Three settings depend on the machine more than on the model, and the defaults are right for the PC they were
measured on (a Ryzen 5 7600 + RTX 5070 on PCIe 5):
  --pcie-frac     the share of the experts missing from VRAM that are copied over PCIe and run on the GPU instead of
                  on the CPU.  A fast PCIe link and a slow CPU want more; a laptop's x8 link or a fast CPU want less.
  --spec-min-p    how sure the draft layer must be to extend a verify window by another guess.  A slower CPU pays more
                  per extra window row (more experts per window), so it wants a higher floor.
  --pool-workers  the CPU threads that compute experts.  Every physical core is not always best: on hybrid CPUs the
                  efficiency cores can make the whole window wait for them.
  --adapt-every / --adapt-swaps / --adapt-decay
                  how the VRAM expert tier follows the conversation: how often, how many experts it swaps in, how fast
                  its use counts fade.  A PC whose CPU reads the missed experts slowly (DDR3, ~24 GB/s) gains from
                  swapping more: 160 swaps every window measured +7.9% over the default tier on a Xeon E5-2673 v3 (DDR3) with an
                  RTX 4060 Ti on PCIe 3.0 x8 (Q2_0; with the swaps taking effect a window later, #764).
The first two are measured through one engine (per-request `strata_tune` keys); the worker count and the adaptive
tier need a restart per value.  Decode speed only: the prompt path streams every expert whatever these settings say.

A setting is kept only when it beats the default by more than MIN_GAIN in an interleaved re-measurement - the
adaptive expert tier and the OS make single measurements noisy by a few percent.

    python tools/calibrate.py strata-q2_0.json        # measure and print; setup.py --calibrate also saves it
